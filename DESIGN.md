## 1. What this project is

**`inscriber`** is a cross-platform command-line tool that converts academic
PDFs into clean, LLM-friendly **text-only Markdown** — running **entirely on the
user's own machine** using local models served by
[**llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). No cloud APIs are
required for the core pipeline.

It is the local, offline-first reimagining of an existing web app called
[**`paper2llm`**](https://github.com/lacerbi/paper2llm). `paper2llm` does the
same job but relies on cloud APIs (Mistral OCR for text extraction; Mistral /
OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic vision models for figure description). The cloud
model landscape changes constantly and is tedious to track. `inscriber` trades
that churn for local control: the user points the tool at llama.cpp plus a
couple of GGUF model files and gets the same kind of output, reproducibly,
without sending documents to third parties.

### 1.1 What "the same job" means (pipeline parity with paper2llm)

For a given PDF, the output is:

1. A **full Markdown file** — the paper's text, tables, and equations, with each
   figure replaced by a generated **textual description** of that figure.
2. **Split files** (unless disabled): the document divided into `main`,
   `appendix`, and `backmatter` parts (see §11).
3. A **BibTeX entry** for the paper when it is judged citable (default `auto`
   mode, §12). The online lookups send only the extracted title / arXiv ID —
   never the document — and are disabled by `--offline`.

### 1.2 Goals

- Fully local core pipeline (OCR + figure description) — works with no internet.
- Runs on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
- Input is a **PDF file path or a URL**; output mirrors `paper2llm`.
- A **config file** specifies the llama.cpp binary location and model paths;
  **every config value is overridable from the CLI.**
- **Pluggable OCR backends** behind a stable interface. **v1 supports one:
  DeepSeek-OCR** — the only currently-supported model that locates figures itself
  in llama.cpp, which the figure→description pipeline requires (§2.4). Other
  SOTA text-OCR models (GLM-OCR, PaddleOCR-VL, Dots.OCR, …) are **deferred**
  pending a figure-detection solution (§22.1 — which also documents the
  experimental, text-only `glm-ocr` registration); the abstraction makes adding
  them purely additive.
- Pluggable **VLM backends** for figure description; first target is the
  **Gemma 4** family (Apache-2.0, multimodal, supported by llama.cpp).
- **Two execution modes** (§3.1): **end-to-end by default** (one command), or a
  **two-step `ocr` → `describe`** flow that materializes an inspectable _OCR
  bundle_ (§8.6) so you can run/compare different VLMs on the **same OCR + figure
  crops** without re-running OCR.

### 1.3 Non-goals (v1)

- No GUI / web interface. CLI only.
- No bundling or downloading of model weights — the user supplies GGUFs.
- No training, fine-tuning, or quantization of models.
- No attempt to perfectly reconstruct multi-page tables/equations that straddle
  a page break (documented limitation, §10.3).
- No OCR of scanned-handwriting or non-document images beyond what the chosen
  OCR model supports.

---

## 2. Background: external facts the design depends on

These were verified in June 2026. A future dev should re-verify against current
llama.cpp before relying on exact token strings.

### 2.1 llama.cpp multimodal support

llama.cpp exposes multimodal (vision) inference two ways, both relevant here:

- **`llama-server`** — a long-running HTTP server with an **OpenAI-compatible**
  `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and a `/health` endpoint. Images are passed as
  base64 data URLs in the chat message content (the standard OpenAI
  `image_url` content-part shape). **This is what `inscriber` uses.**
- **`llama-mtmd-cli`** — a one-shot CLI for a single image+prompt. Reloads the
  model on every call (slow), so it is **not the primary path** — but it is kept
  as a **documented fallback** behind the same backend abstraction (see the
  ⚠️ note below and §8.2), because the server image path has had model-specific
  bugs.

> ✅ **Resolved (M1a, build 9028 — `dev/notes/2026-06-09-m1a-findings.md` Q1).** A base64
> image **round-trips successfully** through DeepSeek-OCR via `llama-server`
> `/v1/chat/completions` — llama.cpp issue #21022 ("number of bitmaps (1) does

>
> ⚠️ **One ordering requirement the OpenAI shape doesn't suggest:** DeepSeek-OCR

> prompt** (M1a Q1b). Text-first silently degrades to plain markdown with zero

> this reason.

A multimodal model in llama.cpp is **two files**:

- the **text model** GGUF (loaded with `-m` / `--model`), and
- a **multimodal projector** GGUF, conventionally named `mmproj-*.gguf` (loaded
  with `--mmproj`), which encodes images into embeddings the text model
  consumes.

So **every** model `inscriber` uses (OCR and VLM) is configured as a
`(model_gguf, mmproj_gguf)` pair.

### 2.2 DeepSeek-OCR (the v1 OCR backend)

- Support was **merged into llama.cpp `master`** via PR #17400 (merged
  2026-03-25). Requires a `deepseek-ocr` model GGUF + `mmproj-deepseek-ocr`
  projector GGUF; reference GGUFs live in the `ggml-org/DeepSeek-OCR-GGUF` HF
  collection.
- **Version note (updated 2026-06-10).** A successor, **DeepSeek-OCR-2**
  (official; arXiv 2601.20552 "Visual Causal Flow", deepseek-ai, ~27 Jan 2026,
  Apache-2.0, new DeepEncoder V2), is now **supported upstream**: llama.cpp
  PR #20975 (merged 2026-05-29 — already included in the pinned build 9587)
  ships it **with multi-tile dynamic-resolution preprocessing**, and GGUFs exist
  (`sabafallah/DeepSeek-OCR-2-GGUF`). It is a **different backend, not a
  drop-in** — on the server path v2 *requires* `--chat-template deepseek-ocr
  --no-jinja` (v1 must NOT pass a template), plus `--flash-attn off` and its
  own DRY tuning. The verification spike RAN 2026-06-10
  (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-dsocr2-spike-findings.md`): grounding format/frame
  confirmed (same block layout, same per-axis render-invariant frame, even
  under tiling) and the v1 known-loop page completes cleanly — but **adoption
  is deferred**: v2 silently loses ≥47% of dense-table numeric values
  (breaking the §9.7 raw-blob fallback premise). **v1 targets the original
  DeepSeek-OCR** (arXiv 2510.18234, the DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M decoder,
  PR #17400); the re-test gate lives in `TODO.md` (§22.2; research record:
  `dev/notes/2026-06-10-upstream-watch.md`).
- **Quirks (must be respected):**
  - Use **f16** weights. **Q4_K_M causes runaway repetition loops** because the
    upstream model uses an **n-gram repetition penalty (ngram_size≈30,
    window≈90)** that llama.cpp **does not implement**. There is no exact
    equivalent flag: llama.cpp's `--repeat-penalty`/`--repeat-last-n` are
    token-level (not n-gram), and the DRY sampler (`--dry-multiplier`) is the
    closest analog — offer these via `server_flags()` as a _partial mitigation_,
    but the **real guards are f16 + a hard `max_tokens` cap + a per-request
    wall-clock timeout + soft-failure** on a looping/truncated page (§5.3, §16).
    ⚠️ **f16 reduces but does not eliminate loops**: a real page looped at BF16
    + grounded prompt + DRY + temp 0 (a dense multi-underbrace equation array;
    2026-06-10, `dev/notes/2026-06-10-equation-fidelity-findings.md`). The cap
    bounded it, and the pipeline **detects the signature**: generation that
    stops at the cap instead of EOS (`finish_reason != "stop"`) flags the page
    `truncated` — best-effort parse kept, loud warning, cached **with the
    flag** and re-warned on every cache hit (§8.6). Known limitation: a loop
    that self-terminates below the cap yields `finish_reason: "stop"` and is
    undetectable this way (text-side heuristics would false-positive on
    legitimately repetitive content). Loop-breaking retry ideas are deferred
    in `TODO.md`.
  - Drive OCR **deterministically**: `temperature: 0` + fixed seed (part of the
    cache key, §8.6).
  - **Chat template is path-dependent.** With **`llama-server`**, do **not** pass
    `--chat-template deepseek-ocr` — the server applies the model's built-in
    template. With the **`llama-mtmd-cli` fallback** (§2.1), the template flag
    _is_ used (the upstream examples pass `--chat-template deepseek-ocr --temp 0`
    to mtmd-cli). So the template choice is **per-path** — see `chat_template(path)`
    in §8.2, not a flat bool. M1 should confirm the server path's behavior.
  - **Prompt.** **`<|grounding|>Convert the document to markdown.`** — confirmed
    in M1a as the working grounded-layout prompt. ⚠️ `<|grounding|>OCR` and plain
    `OCR` (despite being reported working in the llama.cpp guide) produce
    **runaway repetition loops** on this build — do not use them. Plain
    `Convert the document to markdown.` yields clean **ungrounded** text and is
    what `inscriber` sends when figures are disabled (§8.3).
  - **Resolution modes.** DeepSeek-OCR's documented native modes are
    **Tiny (512px)**, **Small (640px)**, **Base (1024px)**, **Large (1280px)**,
    plus a dynamic tiling mode informally called **"Gundam"** (multiple ~640px
    tiles **plus** a 1024px global view) — highest quality, slowest, best for
    dense/multi-column pages. There is **no "standard" mode** (an earlier draft
    invented one). `inscriber` **defaults to `gundam`, rendering 2048 px** —
    inputs ≥1664 px trigger the model's larger **saturated** encoding (431 vs
    283 prompt tokens on 9587), which measurably **eliminates the systematic
    small-subscript misreads** (`θ_t→θ_i`, `p_train→p_min`, `Fail→Full`) at
    ~20% wall-clock cost (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-e2e-quality-findings.md`
    §Render-size experiment); `large` (1280 px) is the faster fallback, and
    the full ladder is exposed (§7, §13). See §7 for the mode→render mapping.
    ✅ **Confirmed (2026-06-10): neither build 9028 nor 9587 tiles**
    (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-gundam-findings.md`, `dev/notes/2026-06-10-build-9587-verification.md`) —
    every input is encoded as one slice (vision tokens saturate for ≥1664 px
    long edge), the grounding frame is the same at every input size, and true
    multi-tile encoding remains pending upstream
    (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-upstream-watch.md` §1).

### 2.3 Gemma 4 (first VLM backend)

- Released April 2026, **Apache-2.0** licensed. Variants: `E2B`, `E4B`
  (multimodal, efficient), `12B`, a `26B-A4B` MoE, and `31B` dense.
- The `E2B`/`E4B` variants are supported as multimodal models in llama.cpp and
  are the recommended figure-description models for `inscriber` (small, fast,
  permissively licensed). Larger variants work if the user has the hardware.
- **GGUF filenames in this doc (e.g. `gemma-4-e4b-f16.gguf`) are placeholders** —
  the user supplies the actual paths; real distributions use their own casing and
  quant suffixes (e.g. unsloth `gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF`).
- Used as a **vision→text** describer (image in, prose out) for figures (§9) and
  as the table restructurer (§9.7). It does not need grounding or special prompts
  beyond the description/table prompts.
- **Gemma 4 is a thinking model.** Hard tasks spend reasoning tokens before the
  answer; llama-server strips the thought channel from `content`. `inscriber`
  activates thinking **explicitly** per request via
  `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": true}` (needs the server's jinja
  templating; a no-op kwarg falls back to the model default). No `max_tokens` is
  sent on VLM calls — generation is bounded by `ctx_size`, and hitting the window
  yields `finish_reason: "length"` (the truncation signal).

### 2.4 OCR model landscape and why v1 is DeepSeek-OCR-only

Several SOTA OCR models are merged into llama.cpp and run via
`llama-server`/`llama-mtmd-cli` as `(model, mmproj)` pairs. **The decisive
difference for _this_ tool is whether the model locates figures itself** — because
the whole point of `inscriber` is converting figures into text descriptions, and
that requires knowing where the figures are.

**Bottom line: DeepSeek-OCR is the only currently-supported model that delivers
the full figure→description pipeline standalone in llama.cpp**, so it is the sole
*supported* backend in v1. GLM-OCR and PaddleOCR-VL are excellent at the _text_
half (SOTA), but in llama.cpp they emit **no figure boxes** — their detection
stage lives in an external PaddlePaddle model. They would only catch figures via
a raster-image fallback that **misses the vector figures common in LaTeX papers**
(matplotlib/TikZ → PDF). Rather than ship a half-working figure path for them,
**their full support is deferred until figure detection is solved** — see §22.1,
which keeps the capability comparison and lists candidate solutions. (A
**`glm-ocr` backend IS registered as an experimental, text-only escape hatch**
— see §22.1 for its caveats.) The `OcrBackend`
abstraction (§8) is built so adding them later is purely additive.

```

**Key design decision — sequential, single-model-resident inference.** OCR and
VLM are different models. To keep peak RAM/VRAM to **one model at a time**, the
orchestrator runs **the entire OCR pass first** (OCR server up), tears that
server down, **then** brings up the VLM server for the entire figure pass. A
power user with plenty of memory can opt into keeping both up concurrently
(§5.4), but sequential is the default.

The OCR cache (§8.6) makes this design especially valuable: re-running with
different VLM settings reuses cached OCR and skips the expensive OCR pass
entirely.

### 3.1 Execution modes: end-to-end vs. two-step

The pipeline above is **end-to-end by default**, but it cleanly factors at the
OCR/VLM boundary (the OCR pass is independent of which VLM describes the figures).
`inscriber` exposes that boundary as three subcommands (§13.2):

- **`inscriber run INPUT`** (default; `inscriber INPUT` is shorthand) — the full
  pipeline, OCR through write, in one process.
- **`inscriber ocr INPUT`** — steps 1–4 only (resolve → rasterize → OCR → figure
  crop), then **write an _OCR bundle_** (§8.6) and stop. No VLM is loaded.
- **`inscriber describe BUNDLE`** — steps 5–10 (VLM table restructuring + figure
  description → assemble → split → BibTeX → write), reading a previously produced
  OCR bundle. No OCR is loaded.

**Why this is more than the cache.** The OCR cache (§8.6) is an internal,
content-addressed optimization for `run`. The OCR bundle is a **portable,
inspectable, user-facing artifact**. The motivating use case — _test/compare
several VLMs on the identical document and figure crops_ — is then just:

```
inscriber ocr paper.pdf -o out/                       # once
inscriber describe out/paper.inscriber-ocr --vlm-model gemma-4-e4b.gguf  ...
inscriber describe out/paper.inscriber-ocr --vlm-model qwen3-vl.gguf     ...
```

Each `describe` reuses the same OCR text and the same cropped figure PNGs, so
differences are attributable purely to the VLM. As a bonus, the bundle's per-page
markdown is **hand-editable** before `describe` (fix an OCR glitch once, then try
N VLMs). `run` is semantically `ocr` immediately followed by `describe`, sharing
the same serialization (§8.6).

A fourth, model-free utility subcommand rounds out the surface:
**`inscriber join BASE`** rejoins the (possibly hand-edited) split files
`{base}_main/_appendix/_backmatter.md` into `{base}_full.md` — the §11
allparts assembly — so post-OCR corrections can be applied **once, to the
splits**, and the full document regenerated instead of edited in parallel
(§11).

A fifth subcommand sits outside the pipeline entirely: **`inscriber setup`**
bootstraps a fresh install — it downloads the recommended GGUF pairs against
a pinned registry and writes/updates the platform config (§13.4). It is the
only subcommand with no input argument and no RunConfig.

---

## 4. Project layout & language

**Language: Python (3.10+).** Chosen because the local PDF/raster/imaging
ecosystem (PyMuPDF, Pillow) is best-in-class there, llama.cpp is consumed as a
subprocess + HTTP, and the reusable logic from `paper2llm` (splitting, BibTeX,
domain handling, the figure-description prompt) ports cleanly.

## 5. llama.cpp server lifecycle (`llama/server.py`)

### 5.1 Ownership model

By default, **`inscriber` owns the server process**: it launches `llama-server`
with the right model/projector/flags, waits for readiness, runs the pass, and
terminates it. The user never hand-manages servers — they only configure the
binary directory and model paths.

A power-user escape hatch: if `--ocr-endpoint URL` (or `--vlm-endpoint URL`) is
given, `inscriber` **does not spawn** a server and instead talks to the
already-running endpoint at that URL. (Useful for remote/GPU boxes or shared
servers.)

### 5.2 Locating the binary (cross-platform)

`llama_cpp_bin_dir` from config points at the folder containing llama.cpp
binaries. To resolve the server executable:

```python
name = "llama-server.exe" if os.name == "nt" else "llama-server"
exe = Path(llama_cpp_bin_dir) / name
```

Resolve with `pathlib`; never rely on `PATH` unless `llama_cpp_bin_dir` is unset
(then fall back to `shutil.which("llama-server")`).

### 5.3 Launch, health, teardown

- **Launch:** `subprocess.Popen([exe, "-m", model, "--mmproj", mmproj, "--host",
"127.0.0.1", "--port", port, "-c", ctx, "-ngl", n_gpu_layers, ...])`.
  - Always use a **list of args** (never `shell=True`).
  - Bind to `127.0.0.1` on an **ephemeral free port** chosen by `inscriber`
    (probe with a socket bind, then pass it to `--port`). Note this is a small
    TOCTOU race — another process could grab the port between probe and the
    server's bind; on a `/health` timeout, retry with a fresh port.
  - **Do NOT add `--chat-template`** for DeepSeek-OCR (§2.2).
  - **Generation-safety flags** (per §2.2): pass repetition-penalty flags via
    `backend.server_flags()`; per-request, send `max_tokens` and `temperature: 0`
    from the client (§8.2). Capture stdout/stderr to a log file under the run dir.
- **Health:** poll `GET /health` until ready or timeout (`server_start_timeout`,
  default 120s). Contract: llama-server returns **503 while the model loads** and
  **200 when ready** — treat 503 as "keep waiting," not fatal. (Under load it can
  also return 200 with `"no slot available"`; for this single-client tool that
  won't occur, but don't assume every 200 means idle.) On timeout, surface a
  clear error including the last lines of the server log.
- **Teardown:** `proc.terminate()`, wait briefly, `proc.kill()` if needed.
  - Register an `atexit`/`finally` + signal handler so a Ctrl-C or crash never
    leaves an orphaned server. `atexit` covers normal exit and Ctrl-C
    (KeyboardInterrupt unwinds, then atexit runs) — but POSIX
    `SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP` **bypass** `atexit`, so `_register_cleanup`
    (`llama/server.py`) also installs default-disposition handlers for them
    that terminate every tracked server and re-deliver the signal (standard
    killed-by-signal exit status; `SIGHUP` is absent on Windows and skipped;
    a handler installed by an embedding application is never stomped). A
    `kill` / logout / supervisor stop therefore cannot orphan a GPU-resident
    server. Use a `contextmanager`:
    ```python
    with server_manager.serve(ocr_model_spec) as endpoint:
        ... run OCR pass ...
    # server guaranteed down here
    ```
- **Cross-platform termination:** `Popen.terminate()` maps to `TerminateProcess`
  on Windows and `SIGTERM` on POSIX — both fine. Avoid `os.killpg`/process
  groups (POSIX-only). If a process group is needed for child cleanup, branch on
  `os.name`.

### 5.4 Concurrency mode

Config `inference.mode`:

- `sequential` (default) — one server at a time; the OCR pass fully completes and
  the server is torn down before the VLM server starts.
- `concurrent` — both servers up simultaneously (faster wall-clock). The real
  constraint is **VRAM**, not just RAM: each server gets its own `-ngl`, so allow
  an independent GPU-layer setting per server rather than a single global value.
  Even in `concurrent` mode, **consult the OCR cache before launching the OCR
  server** (§8.6) — a fully-cached document needs no OCR server at all. There is
  no automatic "do both models fit?" detection in v1; it is the user's
  responsibility, documented as a VRAM caveat. Structural validation rejects a
  fixed `llama.port` together with `concurrent` (two servers cannot share one
  port) — **gated to the `run` subcommand**: `ocr`/`describe` launch a single
  server and ignore `inference.mode`, so a config carrying
  `mode = "concurrent"` + a fixed port must not break them (they have no
  `--mode` flag to escape with).

---

## 6. Input resolution (`input/`)

Input is one positional argument: a **local PDF path** or an **http(s) URL**.

- **Path:** validate it exists, is readable, and has a `%PDF` magic header.
- **URL (requires network):**
  - Run it through **domain handlers** (ported from `paper2llm`). ⚠️ Reality
    check on the source: paper2llm has **no per-site handler classes and no
    generic fallback handler**. The directory `core/domain-handlers/` contains
    only `base-handler.ts`, `generic-handler.ts`, `index.ts` — a single
    **config-driven `GenericDomainHandler`** instantiated once per repository from
    a regex-based config (URL-match + PDF-URL transform + filename rule), wired up
    by `createAllRepositoryHandlers()` in `index.ts`. (Correction, verified
    2026-06-09: a `core/domain-handler-registry.ts` **does** exist one level up — a
    thin `DefaultDomainHandlerRegistry` singleton whose `getHandler(url)` is just
    find-first-`canHandle` over that list. The Python port needs only a list +
    first-match; a registry class is optional.) URLs not matching any config are
    simply **not handled** (no catch-all). One deliberate **parity break**
    (2026-06-11): host matching is by **suffix** (`host_matches`: `host == p or
    host.endswith("." + p)`), not the TS source's substring
    `hostname.includes(...)` — a lookalike host (`arxiv.org.evil.com`,
    `evilarxiv.org`) must not match (it would route the download, and via
    provenance the §12.1 BibTeX chain, to an attacker host), while real
    subdomains (`www.biorxiv.org`, `export.arxiv.org`) still do. Same rule in
    `arxiv_id_from_url` (§12.1 provenance). Pinned by evil-host negative
    fixtures in `tests/test_domain_handlers.py` / `tests/test_bibtex_chain.py`.
  - It ships **seven** repository configs — port all of them (pin each transform
    as a fixture, don't reverse-engineer):
    - **arXiv** `…/abs/{id}` → `…/pdf/{id}`
    - **bioRxiv / medRxiv** (identical rule) `…/content/(10.1101/{id})(vN)?…` →
      `…/content/{id}{vN}.full.pdf`
    - **NeurIPS/NIPS** `…/hash/{x}-Abstract.html` → `…/file/{x}-Paper.pdf`
    - **MLR Press (PMLR)** `…/vN/{id}` → `…/vN/{id}/{id}.pdf`
    - **ACL Anthology** — append `.pdf`
    - **OpenReview** — see special case below.
  - **OpenReview special case:** handled by a **host-level branch in
    `normalizePdfUrl` _before_ the generic transform rules** — it sets the path to
    `/pdf` while `URL.toString()` preserves the `?id=…` query (a plain path rewrite
    that dropped the query would break it). Its **filename** also reads
    `?id=` → `openreview-{id}.pdf` (fallback `openreview-paper.pdf`). Port the
    host-level branch, not just a per-rule replacement.
  - The Python shape can stay a small interface (method names are a free
    re-spelling of paper2llm's `canHandle` / `normalizePdfUrl` / `getFileName`):
    ```python
    class DomainHandler(Protocol):
        def can_handle(self, url: str) -> bool: ...
        def normalize_pdf_url(self, url: str) -> str: ...
        def file_name(self, url: str) -> str: ...
    ```
    …but the **reusable asset is the 7 regex configs**, not hand-written classes.
  - A plain `http://` input URL is **upgraded to `https://`** before any
    request (every supported repository serves HTTPS; a plaintext fetch would
    let a MITM feed attacker bytes to PyMuPDF — unknown hosts are never
    fetched at all, there being no catch-all). If a download is nonetheless
    *served* over plain HTTP (a downgrade redirect), a loud WARNING is
    emitted. `--offline` semantics are untouched.
  - Download with `httpx`, following redirects, with a timeout and a
    descriptive User-Agent. The body is **streamed with a hard size cap**
    (`MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`, 512 MiB — the bytes are buffered in memory for
    PyMuPDF, so an unbounded body on a hostile or misconfigured URL must not
    be able to exhaust RAM; a `Content-Length` over the cap aborts before any
    body is read) and the `%PDF` magic is validated on the **first bytes**,
    so a non-PDF body aborts early instead of being fetched whole.
- Output of this stage: a `ResolvedInput(pdf_bytes, source, original_url,
suggested_name)`.

## 7. PDF rasterization (`pdf/rasterize.py`)

**Library: PyMuPDF (`pymupdf`).** Chosen specifically for cross-platform ease —
it ships prebuilt wheels for Windows/macOS/Linux with **no system dependency**
(unlike `pdf2image`, which needs poppler installed separately, painful on
Windows).

Responsibilities:

- **Page count** — needed to validate/clamp the page range.
- **Page range** — config/CLI `pages` as a **1-indexed inclusive** range,
  clamped to `[1, page_count]`. paper2llm only supports `{startPage, endPage}`;
  the open-ended/shorthand forms (`"1-10"`, `"3"`, `"5-"`, `"-12"`, `all`) are an
  **inscriber convenience, not ported behavior**.
- **Render** each selected page to a PNG at the long-edge pixel target for the
  OCR resolution mode. The zoom matrix is `fitz.Matrix(zoom, zoom)` with
  **`zoom = target_px / max(page_pt_w, page_pt_h)`** — PyMuPDF points are already
  1/72 inch and the matrix is a unit scale, so there is **no `* 72`** (an earlier
  draft had a `*72` that would render ~72× too large).

  | mode     | long-edge target                              | notes                                                                                                              |

  | `gundam` | **2048px (default)**               | the model's larger saturated encoding (≥1664 px input): fixes the systematic small-subscript misreads at ~20% extra wall-clock (§2.2; `dev/notes/2026-06-10-e2e-quality-findings.md`). No model-side tiling on this build — one slice at any size. |

- Return `[PageImage(page_number, png_bytes, width_px, height_px)]`. The
  `(width_px, height_px)` are the **original rendered page** dimensions and are
  the reference frame for `bbox_norm` (§8.2) and cropping (§8.4).

Page images and crops are kept in a per-run **work directory** (under the OS temp
dir or `--workdir`); deleted on **success** unless `--keep-intermediates`, and
**kept on failure/Ctrl-C** for debugging (§15).

## 8. OCR pass & the `OcrBackend` abstraction (`ocr/`)

### 8.1 Why an abstraction

Different OCR models emit different grounding/layout formats, need different
prompts, and may even need a different _number of calls_. The pipeline must not
know these details. So OCR is hidden behind an interface; **v1 supports one
backend, `DeepSeekOcrBackend`** (§8.3; plus the experimental text-only
`glm-ocr`, §22.1), and the deferred text-OCR models (§22.1)
and future grounding models (Dots.OCR, …) are "write a new adapter + register
it", with **zero pipeline changes**. For that promise to actually hold, three
things below are non-obvious and deliberate: (a) the **backend owns the inference
call**, not just the prompt/parse; (b) `bbox_norm` is defined against a **fixed,
explicit frame**; and (c) a backend **declares whether it can ground figures**
(`supports_grounding`), which the figure step (§8.4) reads to choose grounding
vs. the (deferred) fallback path.

### 8.2 The interface (`ocr/base.py`)

```python
@dataclass
class Region:
    label: str                 # e.g. "figure", "table", "text", "title"
    # x1,y1,x2,y2 in [0,1], RELATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL RENDERED PAGE IMAGE
    # (the PageImage width_px/height_px from §7) — NOT the model's padded/tiled
    # frame. The backend is responsible for converting into this frame.
    bbox_norm: tuple[float, float, float, float]
    text: str | None = None    # caption/inline text for this region, if any

@dataclass
class OcrPageResult:
    page_number: int           # 1-indexed
    markdown: str              # clean markdown; figure regions are represented
                               # by ⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:{id}⟧ placeholders (§8.3)
    regions: list[Region]      # all detected regions (figures, tables, etc.)

class Inferencer(Protocol):
    """One multimodal (image+prompt → text) call. Two implementations:
       - HttpInferencer  → llama-server /v1/chat/completions (base64 image)
       - MtmdCliInferencer → one-shot `llama-mtmd-cli` subprocess (fallback, §2.1)
       Backends depend on this, NOT on an HTTP client directly, so the mtmd-cli
       fallback is implementable without changing any signatures."""
    def infer(self, image: PageImage, prompt: str, *, sampling: dict,
              chat_template: str | None, max_tokens: int, timeout_s: float) -> str: ...

class OcrBackend(ABC):
    name: str                  # registry key, e.g. "deepseek-ocr"

    @abstractmethod
    def ocr_page(self, inf: Inferencer, image: PageImage,
                 mode: ResolutionMode) -> OcrPageResult: ...
    """Own the WHOLE inference for one page: build prompt(s), call `inf` (possibly
       more than once, or expecting JSON layout), and return clean markdown +
       regions in the original-page frame. Single-call grounding backends
       (DeepSeek) and multi-call / JSON-layout backends both fit."""

    # capability: can this model locate figures from its own output?
    supports_grounding: bool = False   # DeepSeek-OCR → True; GLM/Paddle → False

    # minimum llama.cpp build the pinned behavior was verified on; the pipeline
    # refuses older spawned servers (model-side preprocessing — e.g. the
    # grounding frame — changes across builds, §2.2). None = no constraint.
    min_server_build: int | None = None

    def server_flags(self) -> list[str]: return []      # e.g. DRY/repeat-penalty
    def sampling(self) -> dict: return {"temperature": 0}  # OCR determinism
    # chat template is PATH-AWARE (§2.2): the value (or None) to use on the
    # llama-server path vs the mtmd-cli path — they differ for DeepSeek-OCR.
    def chat_template(self, path: Literal["server", "mtmd-cli"]) -> str | None:
        return None
```

When `supports_grounding` is `False`, `ocr_page` returns `regions = []` (text
only) and figure detection falls to the experimental PyMuPDF-embedded path
(§8.4) — relevant only to the deferred backends (§22.1), not v1.

The orchestrator, per page, calls `backend.ocr_page(inf, image, mode)` and gets
an `OcrPageResult` whose bboxes are already in the original-page `[0,1]` frame —
so cropping (§8.4) is genuinely model-agnostic and the coordinate-frame mapping
(§8.3) lives **inside** each backend where it belongs.

> Why not the old `prompt()` + orchestrator-owned `client.describe()` + `parse()`
> split? Because it bakes in "exactly one text-returning call per page," which
> JSON-layout and two-call OCR models violate, and it would force per-model
> coordinate-frame logic into the shared crop step. Letting the backend own the
> call is what makes "second backend, zero pipeline changes" true rather than
> aspirational.

### 8.3 The v1 backend: `DeepSeekOcrBackend` (`ocr/deepseek.py`)

(The deferred text-OCR backends and their figure-detection problem are in §22.1.)

- `name = "deepseek-ocr"`; `supports_grounding = True`;
  `min_server_build = 9587` (the grounding-frame gate, §2.2); `sampling()` sets
  `temperature: 0` + fixed seed and a `max_tokens` cap; `chat_template()` is
  path-aware (None on server; `"deepseek-ocr"` on the mtmd-cli fallback) (§2.2).
- Prompt: `"<|grounding|>Convert the document to markdown."` (§2.2; grounding on,
  for the figure boxes). When figures are disabled (`figure.detect = none`, §13),
  use the plain `"Convert the document to markdown."` prompt.
- **`ocr_page` algorithm** (single grounding call → clean text **and** boxes;
  this is the "exact parsing, single pass" decision; format/frame are the
  **M1a-confirmed** facts of §2.2):
  1. Call `inf` once with the grounding prompt (image content-part **before**
     the text — §2.1).
  2. Split the output into ordered **`LABEL[[x1, y1, x2, y2]]` blocks**
     (`MARKER_RE`): each marker line is followed by that region's markdown text,
     up to the next marker. Coords are on the **0–999 per-axis** grid (§2.2).
  3. **Convert coordinates into the original-page `[0,1]` frame** via the
     per-axis mapping (`grid_to_norm`, §2.2): `norm = clamp(grid/999, 0, 1)`
     independently per axis. The mapping is **encapsulated in the backend** so
     `bbox_norm` is always original-page-relative (§8.2). The frame is
     render-size-invariant (Gundam-size included) but **build-scoped** —
     builds ≤ 9028 used a padded-square frame, which is why the backend pins
     `min_server_build = 9587` (§2.2).
  4. **Build clean markdown by _replacing_ each figure block, not blindly
     deleting it.** ⚠️ Critical: for **figure-class** blocks (`label` ∈
     {figure, image, picture, chart, diagram, plot}; this build emits `image`),
     emit a `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:{id}⟧` placeholder token (`id = fig_p{page}_{i}`) in
     the block's position so the description can be injected at the figure's
     real position later (§10.2). The caption is the `image_caption` block that
     immediately follows the figure block — it becomes `Region.text` (used for
     the `{caption_or_label}` in `describe-and-keep`, §10.2) while its text also
     stays in the markdown. For non-figure blocks (text/title/table/…), keep the
     text verbatim. **Do not** strip everything — the placeholder is the only
     anchor and there is no inline `![]()` to fall back on (unlike paper2llm;
     see §10.2, B-note).
- **Robustness:** if grounding markup is malformed/absent, fall back to treating
  the whole output as plain markdown with `regions = []` (no figures described,
  pipeline still succeeds). Log a warning.

> ✅ **M1a (was the highest risk in the design) — DONE.** Real DeepSeek-OCR
> output was captured and committed as golden fixtures
> (`tests/fixtures/deepseek_paper_p1_raw.txt`, `deepseek_calibration_raw.txt`),

> `dev/notes/2026-06-10-build-9587-verification.md` — the capture→compare→re-pin
> discipline in action). Re-run it on any llama.cpp or model upgrade (§22.2).

### 8.4 Figure detection & cropping (`pdf/figures.py`, `pdf/crop.py`)

Figure detection is a **separate step from OCR text** (so future text-only
backends can plug in a different detector, §22.1). Config `figure.detect`:

- **`auto`** (default) — use OCR-backend grounding when
  `backend.supports_grounding`. In v1 that means **DeepSeek grounding**.
- **`grounding`** — force OCR-backend grounding; **error** if the backend can't.
- **`none`** — no figure detection/description (pure text OCR). `--no-figures`
  is an alias for `figure.detect = none` (there is no separate `enabled` flag —
  one knob, no redundancy).
- **`pdf-embedded`** — _experimental, mainly for the deferred text-only backends
  (§22.1)_: use **PyMuPDF** to extract embedded raster images + their page rects
  (`page.get_images()` + `page.get_image_rects()`) → `bbox_norm`. Catches raster
  figures only, **misses the vector figures common in LaTeX papers** — which is
  exactly why GLM/Paddle are deferred rather than shipped on this path. It ships
  in v1 only as an **experimental escape hatch** (it's just PyMuPDF; the test in
  §17 covers it); `auto` never selects it while DeepSeek grounds.

**Placeholder positioning:** grounding splices the `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:{id}⟧`
placeholder at the figure's real position in the page markdown (§8.3 step 4).
(For the experimental `pdf-embedded` path there is no text anchor, so per-page
placeholders are appended after that page's text, ordered by rect `y0`.)

**Cropping** (bboxes already in the original-page `[0,1]` frame, §8.2): pixel box
= `(x1*W, y1*H, x2*W, y2*H)` against the page image (`W,H` = the `PageImage`
dims, §7); add a `figure.crop_padding` margin (default 0.02); clamp; skip
near-zero-area boxes; crop with Pillow; save `figures/fig_p{page}_{i}.png` keyed
by the placeholder `{id}`.

### 8.5 OCR bundle — the two-step artifact (`bundle.py`)

The OCR bundle is the **portable, inspectable output of `inscriber ocr`** and the
**input to `inscriber describe`** (§3.1). It contains everything needed to run
the VLM/assembly stages later, with **no OCR model required**. A directory:

```
OUT/paper.inscriber-ocr/
├── manifest.json     # source meta + OCR config + per-page results
├── figures/          # cropped figure PNGs (fig_p{page}_{i}.png)
└── pages/            # page rasters for table pages (page_NNNN.png, §9.7)
```

Pages whose markdown contains a restructurable `<table>` blob carry a per-page
`raster_path` (e.g. `"pages/page_0003.png"`) — the **verbatim** rendered page
PNG, so `describe` can run the VLM table-restructuring pass (§9.7) with no PDF
present, and `run`/`describe` share table cache keys (the key hashes the
verbatim raster bytes — plus the crop bbox/padding on the cropped path, §9.7). The field is additive: old readers ignore it (`bundle_schema` stays 1),
and a bundle without it simply skips table refinement with a warning.

Every page additionally carries **`raster_sha256`** (the verbatim raster's
hash) and the manifest a top-level **`figure_crop_padding`** (the ocr-time
`[figure].crop_padding`) — the figure-description cache-key material (§9.6:
keys are `(raster, bbox, padding)`), needed because the bundle stores **no
rasters for figure-only pages**. Both additive (`bundle_schema` stays 1); a
bundle without them falls back to keying descriptions on the stored crop
bytes.

`manifest.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "bundle_schema": 1, // integer; the compatibility gate (see below)
  "inscriber_version": "0.1.0", // informational only
  "created_at": "2026-06-09T...Z",

      "raster_sha256": "...", // verbatim-raster hash; figure cache-key material (§9.6)
      "regions": [
        {
          "label": "figure",
          "bbox_norm": [0.1, 0.24, 0.88, 0.61],
          "text": "Figure 1: ...",
        },
      ],
      "figures": [
        {
          "id": "fig_p3_1",
          "page": 3,
          "bbox_norm": [0.1, 0.24, 0.88, 0.61],
          "crop_path": "figures/fig_p3_1.png",
          "caption": "Figure 1: ...",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

Notes:

- **Bundle vs. cache (they are NOT the same serialization).** The OCR **cache**
  (§8.6) stores the _pre-crop_ `OcrPageResult` (markdown + regions) at the OCR
  boundary. The **bundle** is a _superset_: per page it adds the post-crop
  `figures[]` (id, `crop_path`, caption) and the cropped PNGs on disk. So:
  cache = step-3 boundary; bundle = step-4 boundary. `run` threads in-memory
  objects, consults the cache, and skips bundle I/O entirely.
- `manifest.json` is **human-editable**: fix an OCR glitch in a page's `markdown`
  (keeping the `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG⟧` placeholders) once, then run `describe` with N
  different VLMs. Because a re-run of `ocr` would overwrite those edits, `ocr`
  honors `output.clobber` (`--no-clobber` → an existing bundle is a hard error,
  checked before any model work; §14).
- A page whose OCR generation was truncated (the repetition-loop signature,
  §2.2/§8.6) carries `"truncated": true` (additive — old readers ignore it,
  `bundle_schema` stays 1): it marks exactly the page whose `markdown` needs
  the hand-edit above. `describe` does not re-warn — the manifest entry is
  the record (and stays accurate about what OCR produced even after the
  markdown is fixed).
- **`bundle_schema` versioning:** `describe` accepts `bundle_schema <= SUPPORTED`
  and **refuses a higher value** with a clear error (never silently misparse).
  `inscriber_version` is informational and is **not** the gate (it churns every
  release). The §17 round-trip test asserts on `bundle_schema`.
- **What config `describe` honors** (it has no PDF and no OCR model):
  - **Applies:** `[vlm].*`, `[table].*` (§9.7), `[figure].mode`,
    `[figure].context_chars`, `[output].*`, `[bibtex].*` (in `auto` mode the
    citability probe runs on the VLM at describe time, and provenance is read
    from the manifest's `source.original_url` via `Bundle.original_url` —
    §12), `[net].offline`, and
    `[llama].*` + `[inference]` (it still launches a VLM server).
  - **Ignores (baked into the bundle at `ocr` time):** all `[ocr].*`,
    `[figure].detect`, `[figure].crop_padding`. (Ignored ≠ unvalidated: the
    structural layer still checks them like the rest of the file — the
    deliberate global-validation policy, §13.1. The `[ocr]` model *paths* are
    never checked at describe time.)
  - `figure.detect = none` / `--no-figures` at describe time **skips description**
    of bundled figures (leaves the figure out, or as a bare image ref if
    `describe-and-keep` — define as: drop the description, keep nothing).
  - **Output base name** resolves per §14 (explicit `--name` > BibTeX citation
    key > `manifest.source.name` — the only source-derived name available, no
    PDF present). The bundle directory itself is named at `ocr` time
    (`{base}.inscriber-ocr`, explicit `--name` or source-derived) — never by a
    citation key, since no BibTeX exists yet.
- `describe` also validates that every referenced `crop_path` exists.

### 8.6 OCR cache (`cache.py`)

Per-page OCR is the expensive step; cache it.

- **Key:** hash of `(pdf_content_hash, page_number, ocr_backend_name,
model_identity, mmproj_identity, server_build_identity, resolution_mode,
render_long_edge_px, prompt, sampling_params)`. Each item matters:
  - `mmproj_identity` — the projector changes outputs too; hashing only the text
    model (an earlier draft's mistake) misses mmproj swaps.
  - `server_build_identity` — the llama.cpp build serving inference: upstream
    preprocessing/sampling changes (e.g. llama.cpp PR #23345, post-9028) change
    model outputs with identical model/prompt/sampling, so a llama.cpp upgrade
    must bust the cache rather than silently serve stale entries. Probed
    **without launching a server** via `llama-server --version` (the
    `version: …` line only; memoized per binary by path+size+mtime —
    `llama_build_identity` in `llama/server.py`). With `--ocr-endpoint` /
    `--vlm-endpoint` it reads the running server's `/props` `build_info`,
    degrading to `"unknown"` with a warning if unavailable. Consequence: cache
    keys now require the binary (or endpoint) to be reachable even for a
    fully-cached document — the binary is required config anyway.
  - `render_long_edge_px` — a different rendered resolution = a different input
    image even at the same mode name.
  - `sampling_params` — temperature/seed/`max_tokens` (§2.2/§8.2).
  - `*_identity` (model/mmproj) = file path + size + **content hash** (the hash
    itself cached by path+size+mtime so it's computed once). Keying on bare
    `mtime` is fragile: a re-download/copy that preserves content but changes
    mtime busts the cache spuriously, and `touch` without change wouldn't. Hash
    the content.
- **Value:** the **pre-crop** `OcrPageResult` (JSON; markdown with placeholders +
  regions) **plus** raw model output (debugging) and a `value_schema` integer so
  a future backend's richer result can't collide with a v1 entry. **No crops are
  stored** — cropping is recomputed each run from `figure.crop_padding` (which is
  therefore _not_ in the OCR key); the VLM figure key's `(raster, bbox,
  padding)` fields (§9.6) are what protect correctness when crops change.
- **Truncated pages are cached _flagged_, never silently served.** A page whose
  generation stopped at the cap instead of EOS (`finish_reason != "stop"` — the
  repetition-loop signature, §2.2) is still the best available output: it is
  cached with `truncated: true` in the stored result, and **every cache hit
  re-warns**. Rationale: the key above contains every output-determining knob
  (model/mmproj/build, resolution + render px, prompt, sampling incl. the
  pinned `max_tokens` cap), so a recompute could only reproduce the same loop —
  not caching would buy nothing but re-paying the loop's wall-clock on every
  run. Contrast the VLM passes (§9.6/§9.7): their keys deliberately exclude
  `ctx_size`, so a truncated table IS recoverable under the same key with a
  bigger `--ctx` — which is why the table pass does _not_ cache truncation.
  Hard failures (errors) are still never cached.
- **Location:** `platformdirs.user_cache_dir("inscriber")/ocr/`. **Written
  per-page as each page completes** (not batched at the end), so an interrupted
  `run`/`ocr` resumes from the last completed page. The VLM cache (§9.6) is
  likewise written per-figure.
- On a re-run that changes only VLM settings, the entire OCR pass is served from
  cache → the OCR server is never even launched.
- **`--refresh`** ignores existing entries, recomputes, and **overwrites** them.
  **`--no-cache`** neither reads nor writes the cache (pure passthrough). These
  are distinct (§13).

## 9. VLM pass & the `VlmBackend` abstraction (`vlm/`)

### 9.1 Purpose

Each cropped figure is sent to a vision-language model with **surrounding text
as context**, producing a prose description that replaces the figure in the
final Markdown. This is exactly what `paper2llm` does with cloud vision models;
here it's a local VLM (Gemma 4).

### 9.2 Interface (`vlm/base.py`)

```python
class VlmBackend(ABC):
    name: str
    client: ChatClient | None   # attached by the pipeline's VLM session at launch

    def build_prompt(self, context_text: str | None) -> str: ...
    """Assemble the full §9.3 prompt — ALSO the VLM cache-key material (§9.6)."""

    @abstractmethod
    def describe(self, image_png: bytes, prompt: str) -> str: ...
    """Return the cleaned description text (already extracted from tags)."""
```

**One backend instance serves both roles.** The orchestrator assembles each
prompt exactly once via `build_prompt` (and `build_table_prompt`, §9.7), uses
that string as cache-key material (§9.6), and passes the same string into the
inference call — so a cached key can never drift from the request actually
sent. `sampling()`/`chat_template_kwargs()` likewise feed keys and requests
from the single instance the pipeline's `_VlmSession` owns (the session
attaches the chat `client` when the VLM server first comes up).
`GemmaVlmBackend.describe` calls the chat client with the image as a base64
data URL, then extracts the description from the `<img_desc>…</img_desc>` tags
(§9.4).

### 9.3 The figure-description prompt (`postprocess/prompt.py`)

Ported verbatim from `paper2llm` (it is model-agnostic and well-tuned). The
template, with a `{contextText}` placeholder:

```
# Task

Please describe the visual content of this image in detail, focusing on all
visible elements, text, and relevant information.

- Focus primarily on visual elements directly observable in the image: shapes,
  colors, objects, arrangements, and any visible text. When appropriate, include
  reasonable interpretation of what these elements represent based on their
  visual context.
- For academic or technical visuals: Identify the specific type (bar chart, line
  graph, flow diagram, etc.). Describe axes, labels, data points, and visual
  patterns exactly as they appear in the image.
- For any text visible in the image: Provide an accurate transcription,
  maintaining the original layout where meaningful.
- For images with multiple panels: Describe each panel separately based on its
  visual appearance. Note any panel labels if present. If the composition is
  unusual or the panels interact in a non-standard way, explain their
  relationship.
{contextText}

# Format

- Begin with a concise overview sentence identifying the type of image (e.g., "A
  line graph showing...", "A diagram illustrating...", "A photograph of...").
- Then provide specific details in a well-structured format. Use multiple
  paragraphs if necessary to organize different aspects of complex images.
- For complex visuals, you may use bullet points or numbered lists to clearly
  separate distinct elements.
- Adjust the length of your description based on the complexity of the image -
  simple images may need only a paragraph, while complex diagrams might require
  more detailed explanations.

IMPORTANT: You must wrap your entire description inside <img_desc> and
</img_desc> XML tags like this:

<img_desc>Your detailed description goes here.</img_desc>

Do not include anything else outside these tags.
```

When context is available, `{contextText}` is replaced with:

```
# Context

Context for reference:

<context>
{context}
</context>

Use this to correctly identify technical terms and provide reasonable
interpretations of what you can see in the image.
Your image description should still focus primarily on the visual aspects of the
figure and not be a mere repetition of the image caption or provided context.
```

When no context is available, the placeholder is removed.

### 9.4 Response extraction

Extract the substring between `<img_desc>` and `</img_desc>`. If the closing tag
is missing (truncated output), take everything after the opening tag. If the
opening tag is missing entirely, treat the whole (trimmed) response as the
description but log a warning (the model didn't follow format). Ported from
`paper2llm`'s `extractDescriptionFromTags`.

### 9.5 Context extraction

**Baseline behavior is ported from `paper2llm`** (`markdown-processor.ts`
→ `buildImageContextMap` / `extractImageContext`): it uses the **entire page's
text** as the figure's context — not a narrow window — prefixed with a short
preamble and **capped at ~2000 characters** to avoid overwhelming the model:

```
This image appears on page {N}. The surrounding page content follows.

{page_text, truncated to ~2000 chars}
```

This whole-page text becomes the `{context}` injected in §9.3.
**`figure.context_chars` is the truncation cap on the whole-page text, default
`2000`** (paper2llm truncates at `substring(0, 1997) + "..."` only when the page
exceeds 2000 chars) — it is **not** a "window around the figure." A narrow window
is an optional future refinement, but the default must reproduce paper2llm's
whole-page behavior.

Two precision notes for the implementer:

- **The preamble page number is a paper2llm _bug_ — inscriber fixes it.** paper2llm
  does `image.id.split("-")[0]`, but the Mistral image id is like `img-0.jpeg`, so
  this yields `"img"` (or `"unknown"`), **never** a real page number — its preamble
  is effectively always "This image appears on page img." inscriber has the real
  page, so use `N` directly (correcting, not reproducing, the behavior). Do **not**
  port `.split("-")[0]`.
- paper2llm does **not** extract captions separately for context — context is
  purely the whole-page text, and any caption is included only because it lives
  in that text. (`Region.text` from §8.3 feeds the `{caption_or_label}` in
  `describe-and-keep` output, §10.2 — a distinct use from context.)

### 9.6 VLM caching

Same scheme as §8.6, keyed on `("kind": "figure-description",
page_raster_hash, crop_bbox, crop_padding, vlm_backend_name,
vlm_model_identity, vlm_mmproj_identity, server_build_identity,
full_assembled_prompt, sampling_params, chat_template_kwargs)`.

The image identity is the crop's **deterministic inputs** — the verbatim page
raster's hash + the figure's `bbox_norm` + the ocr-time `figure.crop_padding`
— **not** a hash of the re-encoded crop PNG (changed 2026-06-11, adopting the
§9.7 table-key scheme and orphaning pre-change figure entries once): the
crop's *pixels* are fully determined by those three, so the key is immune to
PNG-encoder (Pillow) churn and shared between `run` and `describe` regardless
of which Pillow wrote the bundle's crop files. `describe` reads the raster
hash and padding from the bundle manifest (§8.5 — the bundle stores no
rasters for figure-only pages, so the hash rides the manifest); an **old
bundle** lacking those fields degrades to the legacy crop-bytes hash
(recompute at worst, never a crash). One consequence: the bundle's crop PNGs
are *derived data* — hand-replacing one does not change the key (use
`--refresh`), and conversely hand-editing a figure's `bbox_norm` in the
manifest only re-keys the description, it does **not** re-cut the crop
(`describe` sends the stored crop file; re-run `ocr` to change crops). The
`kind` discriminator keeps figure entries structurally disjoint from
table/probe entries in the shared store.

The key uses the **fully assembled prompt — context text included** — not just a
template name; otherwise changing `context_chars` or the page text would serve a
stale description. `server_build_identity` is the same llama.cpp build probe as
§8.6 (one `--version` subprocess per run, shared across both VLM passes). The orchestrator assembles that prompt once and passes the
identical string into the backend call (§9.2), so key and request cannot drift.
Lets you re-run the document (e.g. to re-split or re-fetch BibTeX) without
re-describing figures.

Truncation policy differs per VLM operation, deliberately: a truncated
**figure description** is still useful prose, so it IS cached — visibly marked
with a trailing `[...]` (the best-effort-but-flagged stance of a truncated OCR
page, §8.6) — while a truncated **table** (§9.7) or **probe** (§12) output is
structurally unusable and is never cached (and stays recoverable under the
same key with a bigger `--ctx`, since `ctx_size` is not key material).

### 9.7 Table restructuring (`postprocess/tables.py`) — tables before figures

> Validated post-v1 in `dev/notes/2026-06-10-table-reconstruction-findings.md`; that note holds
> the experiment history and the prompt rationale. This section is the
> implemented behavior.

**Problem.** DeepSeek-OCR emits tables as **degenerate HTML** — `<table>…</table>`
with most cell boundaries missing, so adjacent cells concatenate
(`Dep. Variable:CCSR-squared:0.616`). All values are present but the grid is
gone, and it is not post-fixable from the text alone.

**Fix.** For each `<table>` blob, ask the VLM to **restructure** it: the blob
supplies the values, the **image** supplies the layout, and the rest of the
page's text supplies correct spellings for merged labels. Low-risk
*structuring*, not re-OCR — the model copies the blob's values (even its typos).

**The image is the cropped table by default** (added 2026-06-10): each blob is
content-matched to its grounded `table[[bbox]]` region — a build ≥9587
capability (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-e2e-quality-findings.md` §Render-size
experiment) — and the crop (+`TABLE_CROP_PADDING` 0.02) is cut from the
verbatim page raster (`crop_region_bytes`, the §8.4 box math). Rationale: the
VLM downscales the whole page to ~896 px, which is exactly where the dense
multi-header failures (5 of 10 PriorGuide tables) and the fusion-segmentation
errors live; a crop arrives near native resolution. Matching
(`match_table_regions`) is content-based against the region's **anchor text**
— its own text, or (the real 9587 shape, §2.2: `table` is an empty block) the
immediately following `table_caption` block's text, which carries the caption
and the `<table>` HTML — exact match preferred, containment fallback, gated to
`TABLE_LABELS`, document order as tiebreak. An unmatched blob (pre-grounding
cache/bundle, hand-edited bundle markdown, an ungrounded table, degenerate
bbox) **falls back to the validated whole-page path**, announced with an INFO
line — the cropped path is strictly an upgrade, never a new failure mode.

Two prompt variants, assembled by `format_table_prompt()` and sent as a single
user message, image first:

- **Whole-page (fallback)** — the validated prompt from the findings note,
  verbatim (count-aware locator + correct-when-certain + page-text context).
- **Cropped** — same prompt with the locator replaced by a crop preamble (a
  cropped image needs no on-page disambiguation) and "the page image" reworded;
  everything from the OCR caveat onward is byte-identical (pinned by a test).
  ✅ **Validated on real hardware and frozen**
  (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-cropped-table-validation.md`, all 10 PriorGuide
  tables, page-vs-crop): crop better on 7, equal on 2 — including both
  fusion-split probes and the row-drift probe, fixed exactly — and worse on 1
  (a silent 6-row drop on the densest table, which is what the digit-coverage
  guard below now catches). Crop completeness was 10/10 (bbox + 0.02 padding;
  only harmless caption/body slivers).

⚠️ **Treat the prompt texts and message shape as pinned**: every ingredient was
added after a simpler version failed (history in the findings note) — do not
reword or restructure them without re-validating on real hardware.

Mechanics, in pipeline order (step 5, **before** figure description so figure
context already sees clean tables):

- **Detection** — well-formed `<table>…</table>` spans only (non-greedy regex;
  an unclosed tag never matches). GLM-OCR emits pipe tables, so it is a natural
  no-op there.
- **Guards** — a blob containing a `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG⟧` placeholder is left alone
  (splicing would destroy the anchor); a blob containing a *nested* `<table>`
  is left alone (the non-greedy match ends at the inner `</table>`, so splicing
  would orphan the outer tail — unobserved from DeepSeek, but model output is
  untrusted); an empty/value-less blob is left alone (nothing to anchor on →
  the task would degrade to re-OCR).
- **Output sanitation** — tolerate a wrapping code fence; reject anything that
  is not purely a pipe table. **Any failure — error, truncation
  (`finish_reason != "stop"`), commentary, empty — keeps the original blob**,
  which still holds every value. (A value-count check was considered and
  rejected: DeepSeek merges cells, so the blob's count is not a baseline.)
- **Digit-coverage guard** (`digit_coverage_ok`, `MIN_DIGIT_COVERAGE = 0.8`) —
  the silent-data-loss detector: the blob's **digit stream** (every digit,
  concatenated; tags/entities stripped first) must reappear in the output at
  ≥ 80%. The stream is invariant under correct re-segmentation (splitting the
  fused `159.99346.68300.4` keeps every digit), while dropped rows delete a
  visible chunk — this is what the rejected value-count idea could not do.
  Calibrated on the validation run: healthy outputs ≥ 0.976, the one silent
  6-row drop 0.664 (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-cropped-table-validation.md`).
  Below the floor → keep the blob, never cache. One-sided: added digits are
  not data loss.
- **One VLM server for both passes** — the orchestrator's lazy `_VlmSession`
  starts the server on the first cache miss from either pass and shares it
  (along with the one backend instance and `VlmCache` both passes' keys are
  built from, §9.2).
- **Caching** — per table, same store as §9.6, keyed on
  `(page_image_hash, backend, model/mmproj/server-build identities, full
  assembled prompt, sampling, chat_template_kwargs)` plus a `kind`
  discriminator. On the cropped path the key **adds `(crop_bbox,
  crop_padding)`** — the crop's pixels are fully determined by (raster, bbox,
  padding), so keying on those instead of re-encoded crop bytes is immune to
  PNG-encoder churn and trivially shared between `run` and `describe` (both
  crop from the same verbatim raster; a cache hit needs no pixel work). The
  fields are added **conditionally**, so whole-page-path keys are
  byte-identical to the pre-crop scheme (warm caches preserved; pinned by a
  test).
- **Two-step** — `ocr` saves the verbatim page raster for table pages
  (`raster_path`, §8.5); `describe` reads it. Bundles without rasters skip with
  a warning.
- **Config** — `[table] refine = true` (default **on**), CLI `--no-table-refine`.
  Describe-stage; **independent of figure settings** (`--no-figures` does not
  disable it, and a run with tables but no VLM configured skips with a warning
  rather than failing).
- **No token budget** — generation is bounded by `ctx_size` alone (the single
  size knob; default 16384 leaves ~6–8k for the VLM's thinking + answer on top
  of the ~2–4k prompt). Gemma 4's thinking is activated explicitly per request
  via `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": true}` (§2.3).

**Open refinements** (deliberately not in this pass — a system/user prompt
split; plus the cropped-prompt validation gate above) are tracked in `TODO.md`.

## 10. Assembly & post-processing (`postprocess/stitch.py`)

### 10.1 Page stitching

OCR is per-page, so the document is reassembled by concatenating per-page
markdown in order. paper2llm exposes **two independent** page options
(`MarkdownOptions.addPageNumbers` / `addPageSeparators`) that `inscriber` keeps:

- **page numbers** — insert `#### Page {n}` before each page's content;
- **page separators** — insert a `---` horizontal rule between pages.

Both default off. **Note:** the splitter (§11) recognizes `#### Page N` markers
and shifts split boundaries around them, so keep the heading shape consistent
(`#### Page N`). Also port `normalizeLineBreaks` (collapse excess blank lines) as
part of the cleanup pass (§10.3).

### 10.2 Figure injection

Replace each `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:{id}⟧` placeholder (spliced in at §8.3 step 4) with
the assembled figure block. The `<img_desc>…</img_desc>` tags are only the
model's _response envelope_ — they are **stripped** (§9.4) — and the extracted
text is rendered as a **Markdown blockquote with a bold header**, every line
prefixed with `> ` (including blank lines, which become `>` so the blockquote
doesn't break across paragraphs/lists in the description).

⚠️ **Port the _format_, not the mechanism.** paper2llm's `enhanceImageReferences`
works by regex-matching the inline `![alt](src)` image syntax that Mistral OCR
emits and keying on image id. DeepSeek-OCR grounding produces **no inline
`![]()`** — which is exactly why §8.3 splices a `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:{id}⟧` placeholder
where each figure was. So reuse only the blockquote/header **formatting** from
`enhanceImageReferences`; the `![]()`-matching loop does not apply.

The **exact header string matters** (the `ensureImageDescriptionSpacing` regex
and downstream tooling depend on it), and paper2llm uses **two different**
headers:

- a real description → **`> **Image description.**`** (`markdown-processor.ts:298`);
- the no-description placeholder → **`> **Image.** [not displayed]`**
  (`markdown-processor.ts:329`).

Config `figure.mode` (mirrors paper2llm's `MarkdownOptions`):

- **`describe-only`** (**default — matches paper2llm**, whose `keepOriginalImages`
  defaults off, i.e. the image is _replaced_ by the description): emit just
  ```markdown
  > **Image description.** {description}
  ```
- **`describe-and-keep`** (paper2llm's `keepOriginalImages = true`; recommended
  for inscriber since we save crops to `figures/` anyway) — keep an image
  reference **and** the description (brackets in the caption are escaped so the
  alt text cannot break the link):

  ```markdown
  ![{caption_or_label}](figures/{id}.png)

  > **Image description.** {description}
  ```

- **`placeholder`** (`replaceImagesWithPlaceholder`): emit
  `> **Image.** [not displayed]` (note: `Image.`, not `Image description.`).

Match paper2llm's trailing newline exactly: each emitted block ends with a single
`\n` (`markdown-processor.ts:312/:315/:329`) so `ensureImageDescriptionSpacing`
(§10.3) behaves identically.

> Do **not** leave raw `<img_desc>` tags in the output — they are an internal
> protocol with the VLM, not part of the document.

### 10.3 Cleanup pass

Two tiers: the **light normalization paper2llm already does** (port verbatim),
plus **new cleanup that local per-page OCR requires** (paper2llm got this for
free from Mistral's whole-document OCR).

**(a) Ported from paper2llm** (`markdown-processor.ts`) — always on:

- **`normalizeLineBreaks`** — collapse 3+ consecutive newlines to a single blank
  line (`\n{3,}` → `\n\n`).
- **`ensureImageDescriptionSpacing`** — guarantee a blank line **before and
  after** each description blockquote (`> **Image description.** …`, and the
  `> **Image.** [not displayed]` placeholder), and around any `Figure …` caption
  line that immediately follows an image block. Operates line-by-line; the real
  regex (`markdown-processor.ts:112`) is
  `^> \*\*(?:Image description|Image Description|Image)\.\*\*` (it tolerates all
  three header spellings — keep it as-is) and `^Figure `. This keeps descriptions
  from fusing into adjacent text.

**(b) New for inscriber** (per-page OCR artifacts) — heuristic, conservative
(never delete content we're unsure about), toggled by `--no-clean`:

- **Running headers/footers & page numbers:** detect short lines that recur at
  the same relative page position across many pages and strip them. Threshold-
  based; log what was removed.
- **De-hyphenation across page/line breaks:** join `word-\nword` → `word`. The
  join is an unconditional `\w-\n\s*\w` (a *hard* compound hyphen that happens to
  sit at a line break is also joined — accepted tradeoff, reviewed and declined
  2026-06-11: soft-vs-hard hyphens are undecidable without a dictionary, and
  DeepSeek emits paragraphs as long lines so the rule fires mostly at the page
  boundaries it exists for; `--no-clean` opts out). A once-planned mid-sentence
  page-break *merge* is not implemented.
- **Known limitation:** tables and equations that span a page boundary may not
  reassemble cleanly. Documented, not fixed in v1.

---

## 11. Splitting (`postprocess/splitter.py`)

Ported from `paper2llm`'s `markdown-splitter`. Splits the full document into up
to three parts by detecting section boundaries via heading regexes (case-
insensitive, any heading level `#+`):

- **Backmatter start** — first match of acknowledgments / author contributions /
  funding / impact statements / ethics, **or** references/bibliography:
  - `Acknowledgments?` / `Acknowledgements?`
  - `Author Contributions`, `Funding`
  - `Impact Statement`, `Broader Impact`, `Societal Impact`,
    `Ethical Considerations`
  - `References`, `Bibliography`, `Works Cited`, `Literature Cited`,
    `Citations`, `References and Notes`, `References Cited`, `Cited Works`,
    `Cited Literature`
- **Appendix start**:
  - `Appendix` / `Appendices`
  - `Supplementary|Supporting (Material|Materials|Information|Data)`
  - `Supplemental …`, `SI …`, `S1.`/`S2.` style headings
  - `A ` / `A. ` style appendix headings — **only accepted if they occur after
    the acknowledgments match** (guards against false positives like "A " in
    body text).
- Title is extracted from the first `# Title` heading, with paper2llm's
  fallbacks: if absent, try a BibTeX `title={…}` field, else default to
  `"Untitled_Paper"` (`markdown-splitter.ts` `extractTitle`).
- If a page marker immediately precedes a split boundary, the boundary is moved
  before it so page markers don't dangle. The marker regex tolerates **H3 or
  H4** (`^#{3,4}\s+Page\s+\d+\s*$`), though inscriber emits `#### Page N`.

Outputs `MarkdownSections(main_content, backmatter | None, appendix | None,
title)`. Positionally in the source, backmatter (acknowledgments/references)
usually precedes the appendix, so the regions are: `main = [0, backmatter_start)`
(or to appendix if no backmatter), `backmatter = [backmatter_start,
appendix_start)`, `appendix = [appendix_start, end)`.

**Standalone split files** must carry paper2llm's section framing (don't just
dump the raw slice): the **main** file's first H1 is normalized to the canonical
title (`prepareFormattedSections`), and standalone **appendix**/**backmatter**
files are prefixed with `# {title} - Appendix` / `# {title} - Backmatter` +
`\n\n---\n\n` (`content-utils.ts` `getSectionContent`, `markdown-splitter.ts`).

**Combined / "allparts" assembly** (paper2llm's `getSectionContent("allparts")`):
the parts can also be re-joined into a single document where appendix and
backmatter are reintroduced under derived headings. ⚠️ Note the **deliberate
reordering**: although backmatter precedes appendix _positionally_ in the source,
`allparts` re-emits in order **main → appendix → backmatter**
(`content-utils.ts:43-66`). This is faithful — don't "fix" it.

```markdown
{main_content}

# {title} - Appendix

---

{appendix}

# {title} - Backmatter

---

{backmatter}
```

This is the basis for the standalone full file (§14) and the
append-BibTeX-to-document option (§12).

**`inscriber join BASE` (the rejoin subcommand).** Reads
`{base}_main/_appendix/_backmatter.md` (BASE = a base path, the `_main.md`
file, or a directory holding exactly one set of splits) and regenerates
`{base}_full.md` next to them — no models, no servers, and no config *file*
needed (an existing config must still be structurally valid like for every
subcommand — the deliberate global-validation policy, §13.1). The
standalone split files already carry the allparts framing, so joining strips
each file's **per-file extras** — the transcription-notice footer, and main's
prepended BibTeX block — concatenates in the allparts order above, then
re-prepends the BibTeX block and re-appends **one** regenerated notice (a
notice crediting "OCR and VLMs" on any split carries VLM involvement into the
joined notice). The intended workflow: hand-correct the splits once, `join`,
and the full document follows — instead of applying every fix twice. ⚠️ The
joined document is the **allparts form**: appendix precedes backmatter under
derived headings, which deliberately differs from `run`'s original
`{base}_full.md` (source order, original headings) — rejoining from splits
cannot recover source order. Implementation: `postprocess/join.py`;
`pipeline.join_splits`; pinned by `tests/test_join.py`.

---

## 12. BibTeX (`bibtex/`)

BibTeX generation is governed by **`bibtex.mode`** (CLI `--bibtex-mode`,
default **`auto`**):

- **`off`** — no BibTeX.
- **`on`** — the original opt-in behavior, ported from `paper2llm` and
  **frozen for parity** (`--bibtex` remains an alias): always look the
  extracted title up via Semantic Scholar title search, mock fallback on
  failure (§12.2). Requires network — under `--offline` it skips with a
  warning. No LLM involved; works with no VLM configured.
- **`auto`** — (default; the probe was validated on real hardware and frozen,
  `dev/notes/2026-06-10-bibtex-probe-findings.md`) decide whether the document is
  *citable*, then produce an entry through an ordered source chain (§12.1).
  Never fails the run: every failure degrades to the next source or to a
  logged skip (§16).

### 12.1 `auto`: citability → source chain (`probe.py`, `arxiv.py`, `local.py`, `chain.py`)

**Citability** is settled in this order:

1. **Provenance** — a source URL matching **any of the seven** recognized
   paper repositories (§6's domain-handler configs;
   `chain.citable_provenance`) is citable by construction. The probe never
   vetoes provenance: an explicit `"citable": false` against a repository URL
   is logged as a disagreement, nothing more. `describe` reads provenance
   from the bundle manifest's `source.original_url` (`Bundle.original_url`,
   §8.5).
2. **The probe** (provenance-less documents) — one cached **text-only** VLM
   call (`probe.py`; the project's only image-less inference) over the first
   processed page's text (post-table-refine, truncated to ~3000 chars — its
   own constant, not the `[figure].context_chars` knob): is this a
   self-contained scholarly work, and which front-matter fields
   (title/authors/year/venue) are visible? The prompt is **pinned
   model-facing behavior** (the §9.7 table-pass discipline): assembled
   exactly once per document via `build_bibtex_probe_prompt`, used verbatim
   as cache-key material AND as the request; the phrase "bibliographic
   metadata" is the pinned test-mock discriminator. It is **abstain-biased**
   ("when unsure, answer false" — with a default-on feature a false positive
   is worse than a false negative) and **transcription-not-recall** (only
   fields visible in the text; absent fields omitted — never
   `Unknown Journal` filler). Parsing tolerates a wrapping code fence
   (observed on real hardware) but is otherwise strict JSON; a
   failed/truncated/unparseable probe means "citability unknown" and is
   **never cached**. No VLM configured → skipped with a warning. A `--pages`
   range that excludes page 1 feeds the probe body text — it will typically
   abstain.

   Mechanics mirror §9.7: the probe runs **inside the open `_VlmSession`**
   (after the figure pass — the server is torn down before the BibTeX step),
   cache-first in the shared VLM store (`make_bibtex_probe_key`,
   `"kind": "bibtex-probe"`; the key embeds the post-refine page text, so
   table-pass settings are deliberately key material), and it runs **even
   when provenance already settles citability** (one cheap, cached,
   text-only call): whether the online sources will fail at lookup time is
   unknowable before the server is torn down, and the best-effort link (step
   4 below) can only use metadata collected here. (Observed failure of the
   earlier skip-on-provenance optimization: an OpenReview input — citable by
   provenance, no arXiv ID — hit a Semantic Scholar 429 on the title search,
   exhausting every online source with no probe metadata to fall back on →
   `no usable metadata` despite a perfectly readable first page.)
3. No provenance and no positive probe → **abstain** (a visible INFO line,
   never a silent skip — and never an unwanted `.bib`).

**The source chain** (network intent = the existing `net.offline` knob —
`--offline` skips steps 1–3). *Preprint provenance ≠ preprint citation*: many
preprints are later published at a venue, so the by-ID step asks Semantic
Scholar first:

1. **Semantic Scholar by arXiv ID** (`lookup_arxiv`; the `vN` suffix is
   stripped — S2 indexes the base ID). Exact identifier match — no title
   validation. A record with a real publication venue → the **published**
   `@article` entry (the same shape as the title-search path); no venue (or
   an "arXiv.org"-style one) → the `@misc` + `eprint` preprint shape.
2. **arXiv export API** (`arxiv_bibtex`; Atom parsed with **`defusedxml`** —
   this is the one place remote XML is parsed, and stdlib `xml.etree` is
   documented as unsafe against malicious data (entity-expansion bombs);
   defusedxml wraps the stdlib parser with entities/external-references
   forbidden, plus `forbid_dtd=True` since Atom needs no DTD. A rejected
   payload degrades like any parse failure — warn + fall through, never
   raise) — the availability fallback when S2 is down/429/recordless:
   the standard `@misc` + `eprint` + `primaryClass` shape. (The export API
   can never know about venue publication, hence second.)
3. **Semantic Scholar title search** — query = the probe's title, else the
   extracted `# Title` (§11); title validation compares against **the same
   string used as the query** (avoids a spurious `% WARNING` from a mangled
   OCR heading). No mock fallback here (that is `on`-mode parity) — failure
   falls through.
4. **Local best-effort** (`local.py`) — fully offline: a clearly-marked
   `@misc` assembled from the probe's transcribed metadata (canonical header
   pinned by `tests/fixtures/bibtex_best_effort.txt`). Requires a title; the
   extracted venue goes in `note`, never `journal`. Entry types stay humble
   (`@misc` / the existing `@article`); type inference is future work
   (§22.2).
5. Nothing usable → logged skip.

Every outcome is one INFO line: `BibTeX (auto): <wrote entry via
{s2-arxiv-id | arxiv-export | s2-title | best-effort} | document judged not
citable; skipping | skipped: <reason>>`.

### 12.2 The `on` path and shared mechanics (paper2llm parity, frozen)

- Extract the paper **title** from the document (`# Title`, §11).
- Query the **Semantic Scholar** API and take the **first result** (`results[0]`)
  as the best match. Exact call (verified 2026-06-09):
  `GET https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query={url-encoded title}&limit=3&fields=title,authors,venue,year,abstract,externalIds,url`,
  response taken from `data.data[0]`. Generate a citation key
  `{firstAuthorLastName}{year}{firstSubstantiveTitleWord}` (shared by every
  §12.1 source too; it doubles as the default output base name, §14) where: author part = the
  last whitespace-token of the first author, lowercased; the title word is the first
  one that is `>2` chars and not a skip-word after stripping non-alphanumerics
  (skip-words, verbatim: `["a","an","the","on","in","of","for","and","or"]`), else
  fall back to the first word; year = paper year or current year. Note Semantic
  Scholar is **rate-limited** for unauthenticated use — degrade gracefully on 429.
  ⚠️ The source has **no explicit 429 handling** (any HTTP error → `[]`); inscriber
  **adds** the clean degrade-and-skip path.
- **No result / API error → mock fallback** (don't just drop it). ⚠️ Source
  precision: `bibtex-generator.ts`'s own `generateMockBibTeXEntry` is **discarded**
  — `generateBibTeXFromTitle` returns **`bibtex === ""`** (empty string) on
  failure, and that sentinel is what drives the include/retry path. The
  user-visible mock — the literal `@article{unknownYear, …, author={Unknown
Author}, journal={Unknown Journal}, …}` prefixed with `% WARNING: This is a
fallback mock citation.` — is assembled in **`content-utils.ts`**
  (`getContentWithOptionalBibtex`), **not** in `bibtex-generator.ts`. **Port the
  `content-utils` mock text and the empty-string sentinel** (not the discarded
  generator mock).
- **Title validation:** compare document title vs. returned title under a
  normalized comparison (`BibTeXTitleValidation`). Exact rules (verified 2026-06-09):
  normalize = lowercase → strip everything but `[a-z ]` → collapse whitespace → trim;
  titles whose normalized length is `<10` chars require an **exact** normalized match;
  longer titles match when the word-overlap ratio
  `commonWords / max(origWordCount, bibtexWordCount)` is **strictly `> 0.75`**.
  On mismatch, still emit the entry but prepend
  paper2llm's **exact 4-line** warning (note the trailing `% ` line):
  ```
  % WARNING: The retrieved citation title may not match the paper title.
  % Paper title: "{original_title}"
  % Citation title: "{bibtex_title}"
  %
  ```
  (paper2llm also has a slightly different mismatch wording —
  `% WARNING: The paper title does not match the citation title.` — inside the
  _mock_ branch; inscriber **standardizes on the one 4-line form above** for both
  paths, intentionally.)
- **Placement** (`content-utils.ts` `getContentWithOptionalBibtex`):
  - write a standalone `{base}.bib` (default); **and/or**
  - **inject the entry into the document** (`bibtex.append_to_document`). ⚠️
    paper2llm **prepends** it (before the content) and wraps it in a **fenced
    code block** with a `---` separator — not a bare append:

    ````
    ```
    {bibtex, incl. any % WARNING lines}
    ```

    ---

    {document content}
    ````

    Only for `section ∈ {full, main, allparts}`. The **Placement** rules apply
    to whatever entry any mode produced (`auto` included).

- Respects `--offline` (skips with a clear message) and network failure (warns,
  continues — never fails the whole run for BibTeX).
- **On `retryBibtexGeneration` (§24 row 17):** in paper2llm this is an
  _interactive UI affordance_ (re-run when the user ticks the include-BibTeX box
  after a prior failure). A one-shot CLI has no such surface, so it is **not a
  faithful pipeline port** — model it as "re-running with `--bibtex` (cache makes
  this cheap) re-attempts the lookup," and it is listed under reclassified items,
  not as a literal feature.

---

## 13. Configuration & CLI

### 13.1 Config file (TOML)

Default discovery checks the current working directory first:

- `./config.toml`

If no local config exists, the fallback location is resolved via
**`platformdirs`**:

- Linux: `~/.config/inscriber/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/inscriber/config.toml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\inscriber\config.toml`

Overridable with `--config PATH`. **Every field is overridable by a CLI flag.**
Precedence: **CLI flag > config file > built-in default.**

**Validation policy (deliberate, recorded 2026-06-11):** *structural*
validation — enum membership, numeric ranges, types — is **global**: an
existing config file must be valid in its entirety regardless of the
subcommand, so a typo'd `[ocr]` value fails `join`/`describe` loudly too
(garbage anywhere in the config is an error everywhere; the message names the
exact key). What IS command/stage-scoped is the *path-existence* layer
(binary/model files), which only runs just before the server that needs them
launches — `join` never touches it, and `describe` never validates `[ocr]`
model paths (§8.5). Per-command scoping of the structural checks was
considered and declined: it would mean a command→keys map that must track the
§13.3 stage table forever, to convert a clear self-explanatory error into a
pass — revisit only on real user reports of being blocked by an irrelevant
key.

### 13.2 CLI surface (`cli.py`, argparse subparsers)

Five subcommands (§3.1). `run` is the default — bare `inscriber INPUT` ≡
`inscriber run INPUT`. Flags below are grouped by the stage they affect; each
subcommand accepts only the groups relevant to it (`join` takes only
`-c`, `--no-clobber`, `--no-full-suffix`, `-v`/`-q`; `setup` takes only its
own group plus `-c`, `-v`/`-q`).

```
inscriber run     INPUT [options]     # end-to-end (default)
inscriber ocr     INPUT [ocr-options] # OCR + crop → write OCR bundle, stop
inscriber describe BUNDLE [vlm-options]# OCR bundle → VLM + assemble + write
inscriber join    BASE                # rejoin {base}_main/_appendix/_backmatter.md

### 13.3 Config ↔ CLI mapping (the "every field is overridable" contract)

| config key                                             | CLI flag                                                                          |

Every config field now has a CLI override (the §1.2 promise holds literally);
`--server-timeout` and `--no-normalize-breaks` were added for that reason.
`[figure]` straddles stages: `detect`/`crop_padding` are **ocr-stage** (baked
into the bundle), `mode`/`context_chars` are **describe-stage** (§8.5).

### 13.4 `inscriber setup` — model download + config bootstrap

`inscriber setup` (the fifth subcommand, §3.1) turns a fresh install into a
runnable one: it downloads the recommended GGUF pairs and writes the platform
config. It lives **outside the pipeline** (`inscriber/setup.py`): no
RunConfig, no servers, no caches — httpx, hashlib, and a config writer. It is
inherently online and opt-in; it reads no config (it *writes* one), so
`[net].offline` does not apply. Pinned by `tests/test_setup.py` (HTTP mocked
at the transport boundary).

- **Pinned registry.** Each managed file (DeepSeek-OCR BF16 — or Q8_0 via
  `--deepseek-quant q8_0` — and Gemma 4 E4B QAT, each a model+mmproj pair)
  carries its upstream URL plus the exact **byte size and sha256** published
  by the Hugging Face API (the LFS `oid`, captured 2026-06-11). Downloads are
  tamper-evident, and a silent upstream re-upload fails loudly with a pointer
  to the README's manual-download table. **The registry pins and that README
  table must be updated together.** The unsloth Gemma projector (upstream
  name: the generic `mmproj-BF16.gguf`) is saved under a Gemma-specific local
  name — the README's manual rename advice, baked in.
- **Download mechanics.** Files land in `--models-dir` (default:
  `platformdirs.user_data_dir("inscriber")/models`). Streaming goes to a
  `{name}.part` with a `Range` resume (a 200 to a ranged request restarts
  cleanly; a 416 means the partial is already complete and proceeds to
  verification); only a size+hash-verified file is promoted to its final name
  (atomic `Path.replace`). Re-running is idempotent: complete files are
  hash-verified and skipped without any HTTP, partials resumed, and a hash
  mismatch deletes the partial so the retry starts clean. A pre-existing
  final file with the wrong size or hash is **never overwritten** — setup
  errors and tells the user to delete it or pick another `--models-dir`. A
  disk-space preflight (missing bytes + 1 GiB headroom) fails before any
  download starts.
- **Config write.** Target = `-c PATH`, default the **platform** config path
  (§13.1) — unlike every other subcommand, setup's `-c` names a file that may
  not exist yet (it is the write target, not an input). A missing target gets
  a minimal commented config holding only the managed keys
  (`[ocr]/[vlm] model/mmproj`, plus `[llama].bin_dir` when `--llama-bin-dir`
  was given); an existing one is parse-merge-emitted — every key (known or
  unknown) is preserved, **comments are not** (logged when it happens). Paths
  are emitted `as_posix()` (forward slashes work on every platform and need
  no TOML escaping). If `./config.toml` exists, setup notes that it shadows
  the platform config when running from that directory.
- **llama.cpp stays a manual step** — deliberately out of scope: the
  OS × GPU-backend release matrix plus the ≥ 9587 build gate (§2.2) would
  make auto-fetched binaries a support liability. Without `--llama-bin-dir`,
  setup prints the releases URL and the build requirement as the one
  remaining step; with it, setup warns when `llama-server` is not actually
  there (the path is still written — install later).
- **stdout contract (§16):** the model paths + the config path, one per line.

## 14. Output layout (`output.py`)

Given a resolved base name `chang2025amortized` and output dir `OUT`:

```
OUT/
├── chang2025amortized_full.md        # full document (always)
├── chang2025amortized_main.md        # if split = true and split succeeded
├── chang2025amortized_appendix.md    # if an appendix section was detected
├── chang2025amortized_backmatter.md  # if a backmatter section was detected
├── chang2025amortized.bib            # when BibTeX produced an entry (§12)
└── figures/                          # if figure-mode keeps images
    ├── fig_p1_1.png
    └── ...
```

- **Base-name resolution** (`_resolve_output_base`; one INFO line always says
  which name won and why):
  1. **`--name`** — explicit override, sanitized. Per-run like `--pages`
     (`RunConfig.name`), so deliberately **CLI-only, no config key** — a
     persistent name in config.toml would name every run's outputs
     identically.
  2. **The BibTeX citation key** (`output.name_from_bibtex`, default **true**)
     — when the run produced an entry (§12), its key
     (`{firstAuthorLastName}{year}{firstSubstantiveTitleWord}`, §12.2) names
     the outputs. Passive: it only consumes an entry the bibtex stage produced
     anyway (never triggers lookups/probes), and the `on`-mode **fallback mock
     never names files** (detected by its pinned warning line). ⚠️ Name
     stability caveat: the key depends on which source produced the entry, so
     an offline best-effort run can yield a different name than an online S2
     run — and since clobber only overwrites same-named files, `OUT/` can
     accumulate both. The INFO line makes this diagnosable.
  3. **Source-derived fallback**: for `run`, the PDF filename **stem**
     (`Path(...).stem`) or the domain handler's `file_name(url)`; for
     `describe`, `manifest.source.name` (no PDF present, §8.5).
  Because BibTeX runs at describe time, the **`ocr` bundle** can only get an
  explicit `--name` or the source-derived name — never a citation key (§8.5).
- Names are sanitized (`sanitize_base_name`: dots/spaces → `_`; a Windows
  reserved device stem — `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`–`9`, `LPT1`–`9` —
  gets a trailing `_` so the unsuffixed outputs `{base}.bib` / `{base}.md`
  stay writable); the `_part` suffix on every document output does the rest
  of the collision avoidance.
- `{base}_full.md` is the **full** document (the enhanced, stitched markdown).
  After hand-editing the splits, `inscriber join OUT/{base}` regenerates it
  from them (in the §11 allparts form).
- **`output.full_suffix = false`** (`--no-full-suffix`; also accepted by
  `join`) writes the full document as **`{base}.md`** instead — library-style
  one-file naming, natural with `--no-split` or a one-file-per-paper corpus.
  Split files keep their `_part` suffixes either way (`{base}.md` cannot
  collide with the *same* document's `{base}_main.md`; a base name that itself
  ends in a part suffix could collide with *another* document's split in the
  same directory — warned at write time). Deliberately an explicit knob, not an
  automatic when-not-splitting behavior — the output filename must not depend
  on an unrelated option.
- **Two distinct `figures/` dirs:** the **bundle** always has one (crops are made
  at `ocr` time, before `mode` is chosen — §8.5); the **output** dir gets one only
  when `figure.mode = describe-and-keep` (the only mode that references crops),
  else only under `--keep-intermediates`.
- All files written **UTF-8 explicitly**, with `\n` newlines (don't let Windows
  inject `\r\n`).
- Default overwrites existing outputs (`output.clobber = true`), logging each
  file written; `--no-clobber` makes a pre-existing target a hard error instead.
  This includes the **`ocr` bundle**: with `--no-clobber`, an existing
  `{base}.inscriber-ocr/manifest.json` fails fast (before any model work) —
  protecting hand-edited bundle markdown (§8.5) from a careless re-run.

---

## 15. Cross-platform requirements (Win / Linux / macOS)

These are hard requirements, not nice-to-haves:

- **Paths:** `pathlib.Path` everywhere; never string-concatenate paths. Resolve
  user `~` with `Path.expanduser()`.
- **PDF rendering:** PyMuPDF (wheels, no system poppler). **Do not** introduce a
  dependency that needs a separate system install on Windows.
- **Binary discovery:** append `.exe` on `os.name == "nt"` (§5.2).
- **Subprocess:** list-args only, no `shell=True`; `Popen.terminate()` for
  teardown (works on all three). Avoid POSIX-only `os.killpg`/`preexec_fn`
  unless guarded by an `os.name` branch.
- **Config/cache/data dirs:** `platformdirs` (`user_config_dir`,
  `user_cache_dir`, `user_data_dir`) — never hardcode `~/.config`.
- **File encoding:** always `encoding="utf-8"`, `newline="\n"` when writing text.
- **Temp/work dir:** `tempfile.mkdtemp()` or `workdir.path`; managed by a
  contextmanager. **Delete on success** (unless `keep_intermediates`); **keep on
  failure/Ctrl-C** for debugging.
- **`tomli`** is a _conditional_ dependency only — declare it
  `tomli; python_version < "3.11"` and do `import tomllib` with a `tomli`
  fallback (3.11+ has `tomllib` in the stdlib). Don't add it unconditionally.
- **`shutil.which`** (the PATH fallback in §5.2) honors `PATHEXT` on Windows, so
  it finds `llama-server.exe` without manual suffixing.
- **`--offline` does not gate the local servers.** The OCR/VLM `llama-server`
  processes are loopback (`127.0.0.1`), not "network" in the privacy sense —
  `--offline` only disables URL input and the online BibTeX sources; the
  BibTeX `auto` probe and best-effort entry are loopback-local and stay
  available under `--offline` (§12). Do **not** wrongly block server
  spawn behind `--offline`.
- **GPU backend** (Metal on macOS, CUDA/Vulkan/etc. on Win/Linux) is whatever
  the user's llama.cpp build supports. `inscriber` stays agnostic and only
  passes `-ngl`.
- **CI:** test on all three OSes in the matrix (§17). No GPU in CI → servers are
  mocked.

---

## 16. Error handling, logging, progress

- **Fail fast, fail clearly** on config errors (missing model files, missing
  binary, unreadable PDF) — validate everything in `config.py` before any model
  loads.
- **Per-stage progress** to stderr: rasterizing (n pages), OCR (page i/N), VLM
  (figure i/M), assembling, splitting, bibtex, writing. A simple counter is
  enough; a progress bar (e.g. `rich`/`tqdm`) is a nice-to-have.
- **Resilience:** a single figure that fails to describe should not kill the run
  — log it, insert a `[figure description unavailable]` placeholder, continue.
  Same for BibTeX failures — in `auto` mode the source chain degrades source by
  source down to a logged skip (§12) — and for an OCR page that loops/truncates
  (§2.2): best-effort parse what came back, flag it `truncated`, warn loudly
  (on compute and on every later cache hit, §8.6), move on.
- **stdout vs stderr:** progress/logs go to **stderr**; on completion print the
  **list of written file paths to stdout** (one per line) so the run is
  machine-parseable even under `-q`.
- **Server failures:** on a `/health` timeout or non-200 chat responses, include
  the tail of the captured server log in the error so the user can diagnose
  (wrong model/mmproj pairing, OOM, bad flags). A server dying *during model
  load* may not have flushed its stdio yet, so an empty tail is re-read once
  after a short settle, and the error always names the log file's **path** —
  the user can read the full log even when the tail came up empty.
- **Logging:** standard `logging`; `-v` → DEBUG (includes raw model outputs when
  `--keep-intermediates`), default INFO, `-q` → WARNING.

---

## 17. Testing strategy (`tests/`)

The real models need a GPU/large RAM and aren't available in CI, so tests mock
the inference layer at the **chat-client boundary**.

- **`test_deepseek_parser.py`** — golden-string tests for the DeepSeek grounding
  parser (§8.3) using **recorded real outputs** as fixtures: tokens + the
  M1-confirmed coordinate-frame mapping. Highest-value test; the single-pass
  grounding design hinges on exact parsing. (Per-backend variants land with each
  deferred backend, §22.1.)
- **`test_bundle_roundtrip.py`** — `ocr` writes a bundle; `describe` loads it and
  produces output consistent with `run` (same base name from `manifest.source.name`,
  §8.5); a hand-edited page markdown survives; a `bundle_schema` higher than
  supported is rejected (§8.5).
- **`test_tables.py`** — the table-restructuring pass (§9.7): blob detection /
  guards / sanitation / splicing units, blob↔table-region matching + in-memory
  cropping, the cropped/whole-page prompt variants (shared-tail pin), thinking-
  kwarg + `finish_reason` truncation, cache-key disjointness (incl. the
  conditional crop fields + the pinned legacy whole-page payload), and mocked
  `run` + `ocr`→`describe` integration (verbatim bundle rasters → shared
  cropped-path keys, old-bundle and no-VLM degradation, crop-vs-page image
  assertions, whole-page fallback with multi-table locators, concurrent mode).
- **`test_pdf_embedded_figures.py`** — `figure.detect = pdf-embedded` on a fixture
  PDF with an embedded raster figure yields a crop + appended placeholder (§8.4).
- **`test_splitter.py`** — section-detection on a battery of synthetic markdown
  docs (with/without appendix, backmatter, the `A ` edge case, page markers).
- **`test_join.py`** — the `join` subcommand (§11): allparts round-trip from
  pipeline-shaped splits, single regenerated notice (+ VLM-involvement
  inference), BibTeX-block re-prepend, hand-edit/CRLF tolerance, BASE
  resolution errors, CLI clobber behavior.
- **`test_setup.py`** — the `setup` subcommand (§13.4): registry integrity
  (roles/urls/pins), download mechanics against an httpx ``MockTransport``
  (fresh / resume / ignored-Range restart / 416-complete / hash-mismatch
  cleanup / verified-skip without HTTP / never-overwrite conflicts), the
  disk-space preflight, fresh-vs-merge config writes (unknown keys preserved,
  LF+UTF-8), and CLI dispatch.
- **`test_stitch.py`** — header/footer stripping & de-hyphenation on crafted
  multi-page inputs.
- **`test_config.py`** — TOML load, CLI-override precedence, validation errors
  (incl. the `bibtex.mode` tri-state).
- **`test_bibtex.py` / `test_bibtex_probe.py` / `test_bibtex_chain.py`** — the
  §12 surface: citation key / title validation / mock fallback (`on`-mode
  parity), the probe (prompt assembly, fence-tolerant parsing, truncation,
  never-cache-failure, key disjointness), and the auto chain (every
  fall-through, provenance behavior, `--offline`, httpx mocked).
- **`test_pipeline_mocked.py`** — end-to-end on a tiny fixture PDF with the OCR
  and VLM clients **mocked** to return canned responses; asserts the full set of
  output files and figure injection.
- **`LlamaServerManager`** — unit-test launch-arg construction and the `.exe`
  suffix logic without actually spawning (mock `Popen`).
- A **manual/integration** test doc (not in CI) describes how to run against a
  real llama.cpp + real GGUFs, with a known sample PDF, for release validation.

`npm`-style smoke check equivalent: `inscriber --version` and
`inscriber sample.pdf --no-figures --offline` against a fixture should pass with
mocked servers.

## 18. Packaging & distribution

- **`pyproject.toml`** (PEP 621), build backend `hatchling` or `setuptools`.
- Console entry point: `inscriber = "inscriber.cli:main"`.
- **PyPI name: `inscriber`** — **published since v0.1.0 (2026-06-11)**.
  Releases are tag-driven: pushing a `v*` tag runs
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds sdist+wheel, gates the tag
  against the `pyproject.toml` version, and publishes via **PyPI Trusted
  Publishing** (OIDC against the `pypi` environment — no API token exists
  anywhere). The sdist excludes the developer-only dirs (`dev/`, `.github/`,
  `.claude/`, `.agents/`); tests and docs ship in it.
- Python `>=3.10`.
- License: **MIT** (matches `paper2llm`).
- Optional extras: `[bibtex]` could gate the Semantic Scholar dependency if it's
  more than `httpx`, but keep core deps minimal.

## 19. Performance & resources

- **DeepSeek-OCR at f16 + a Gemma 4 VLM** are the main memory consumers. The
  **sequential** mode (§5.4) keeps only one resident at a time — the default for
  good reason.
- **Resolution** is the main speed/quality lever: `gundam` (default, 2048px —
  the saturated encoding, ~20% slower than `large` wall-clock) measurably
  reduces subscript/word misreads; `large` (1280px) is the faster fallback;
  `base`/`small`/`tiny` are the speed escape hatches.
- **Caching** (§8.6/§9.6) makes iteration cheap — changing split/figure/bibtex
  options re-runs in seconds because OCR and VLM results are reused.
- **GPU offload** via `-ngl` is the biggest wall-clock win when available; left
  to the user's hardware/build.

---

## 20. Security & privacy

- **Documents and models are local.** Documents and figures are **never** sent
  to any third-party model API — they go only to the user's own llama.cpp
  server on `127.0.0.1`. The only network egress is (a) downloading a PDF when
  the input is a URL and (b) the default-`auto` BibTeX lookups (§12), which
  send **only the extracted title / arXiv ID** to citation APIs (Semantic
  Scholar, arXiv) — never the document. Both are disabled by `--offline`
  (BibTeX then degrades to its fully-local probe + best-effort entry).
- The server binds to **loopback** on an ephemeral port; it is not exposed.
- No telemetry. No persisted secrets (there are no API keys in the core flow).

## 21. Implementation milestones

1. **M0 — Skeleton.** Project layout, `pyproject.toml`, CLI argparse →
   `RunConfig`, TOML config load/merge/validate, logging. `inscriber --version`
   and config errors work.
2. **M1a — De-risk spike (do this first).** `Inferencer` (HTTP impl +
   mtmd-cli impl, §8.2) + `LlamaServerManager` + PyMuPDF rasterize, then **the two
   highest-risk unknowns**: (i) prove a base64 image round-trips through
   DeepSeek-OCR on `/v1/chat/completions` for the pinned llama.cpp build, _or_
   fall back to `llama-mtmd-cli` (§2.1); (ii) **capture real grounding output** to
   `tests/fixtures/` and **determine the coordinate frame empirically** (§8.3 step
   3 / §2.2). Nothing else can be trusted until this lands.
3. **M1b — OCR vertical slice.** `DeepSeekOcrBackend.ocr_page` with the parser +
   coordinate mapping **locked to the M1a fixtures**, the OCR cache, and per-page
   markdown (with `⟦INSCRIBER_FIG⟧` placeholders) for a real PDF. **Design the
   `OcrPageResult` (de)serialization once here** — it's reused by both the cache
   (M1b) and the bundle (M2), so don't pick a format the bundle must later migrate.
4. **M2 — Figures + two-step split.** Figure detection (§8.4: grounding for
   DeepSeek), cropping, VLM server + `GemmaVlmBackend`, prompt + extraction,
   whole-page context, blockquote injection (§10.2), VLM cache. **Land the
   `ocr`/`describe` subcommands and OCR-bundle read/write here** (§3.1, §8.5) —
   it falls out naturally once the OCR↔VLM boundary is serialized, and it's the
   workflow that makes VLM comparison cheap.
5. **M3 — Assembly & splitting.** Stitching, the ported light post-processing +
   new cleanup (§10.3), splitter with standalone-file headers (§11), output
   writer (full + splits + figures/).
6. **M4 — Inputs & BibTeX.** URL input + the 7 domain configs (§6), `--offline`,
   Semantic Scholar BibTeX with title validation, mock fallback, and
   prepend/fenced injection (§12). (GLM-OCR / PaddleOCR-VL are **not** here —
   post-v1, gated on figure detection, §22.1.)
7. **M5 — Hardening.** Cross-platform CI matrix, mocked end-to-end tests,
   `concurrent` mode, docs/README, packaging to PyPI.

## 22. Open questions / future work

> Concrete, near-term actionables (pending verifications, code debts) are
> tracked in **`TODO.md`** — this section is the longer-horizon work.

### 22.1 Deferred OCR backends: GLM-OCR & PaddleOCR-VL (text-SOTA; figures TBD)

GLM-OCR (#19677) and PaddleOCR-VL-1.5 (#18825) are **SOTA at text/table/equation
OCR** and would be valuable backends — `inscriber`'s `OcrBackend` abstraction (§8)
is built to accept them additively (`name`, `ocr_page`, `supports_grounding`,
prompt/parse). They are **deferred from v1 for one specific reason**: in
llama.cpp they emit **no figure bounding boxes**, and `inscriber`'s core job is
turning figures into descriptions.

> **Experimental `glm-ocr` registration (decision recorded 2026-06-11).** A
> `GlmOcrBackend` (`ocr/glm.py`) ships **registered** as an experimental,
> text-only escape hatch — reachable via `--ocr-backend glm-ocr`. Caveats: no
> figure grounding (`supports_grounding = False` — pair it with `--no-figures`,
> or accept the experimental `pdf-embedded` detector, §8.4); the table pass is
> a natural no-op (GLM emits pipe tables, not `<table>` blobs); and unlike
> DeepSeek its prompt/output behavior is **not pinned on real captured output**
> (the §8.3 M1 discipline) — treat results accordingly. *Supported* status
> still requires the figure-detection decision below plus a real-hardware
> pinning pass.

- **GLM-OCR** is text-only by design (it deliberately doesn't predict
  coordinate tokens; upstream pairs it with PP-DocLayoutV3).
- **PaddleOCR-VL** _has_ layout detection, but as a **separate PaddlePaddle model
  (PP-DocLayout), not in llama.cpp** — standalone in llama.cpp it recognizes
  content without reliable figure localization.

So the blocker is **figure detection**, and shipping them means picking a
solution (all TBD; each is a tradeoff):

1. **External layout model (PP-DocLayout / PP-DocLayoutV3).** Highest fidelity,
   matches upstream usage; lets the backend set `supports_grounding = True`.
   Cost: heavy optional PaddlePaddle dependency, extra model to manage, more
   integration — keep strictly opt-in.
2. **PyMuPDF vector-aware detection.** Cluster the PDF's vector drawings
   (`page.get_drawings()` / `cluster_drawings()`) **plus** raster image rects to
   infer figure regions. No extra model/dependency, fully local. Cost: heuristic
   — risks catching tables/equations/rules or splitting composite figures; needs
   tuning and validation.
3. **`pdf-embedded` raster fallback only** (the experimental path, §8.4). Cheap
   and already specified, but **misses the vector figures common in LaTeX
   papers** — acceptable only for raster-heavy/scanned PDFs, not as the general
   answer.
4. **Prefer a grounding-capable model instead.** If the goal is "another backend
   besides DeepSeek," **Dots.OCR** (#17575) emits JSON layout _with_ boxes and
   may be a better next target than retrofitting detection onto GLM/Paddle.

**Recommendation when this is picked up:** treat GLM-OCR/PaddleOCR-VL as
**text-OCR backends** first (figure detection via option 1 or 2), pin each
model's prompt and output format on real captured output (same M1 discipline as
DeepSeek, §8.3), and decide whether `pdf-embedded` is an acceptable interim
default for them or whether figures should simply be `none` until a real detector
is wired.

### 22.2 Other future work

- **More grounding-capable OCR backends** — Dots.OCR (#17575, JSON layout _with_
  boxes; natural next backend) and HunyuanOCR (#21395).
- **DeepSeek-OCR-2** (arXiv 2601.20552, DeepEncoder V2 "Visual Causal Flow";
  +3.73% OmniDocBench, reading-order edit 0.085→0.057, repetition rate ~⅓
  lower, native multi-tile dynamic resolution) — **upstream support landed**
  (llama.cpp PR #20975, merged 2026-05-29; GGUFs available; **the pinned
  build 9587 already includes it**). The verification spike ran 2026-06-10
  (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-dsocr2-spike-findings.md`): format + per-axis frame
  confirmed under tiling with the M1a calibration discipline, the v1
  known-loop page completes cleanly — but **adoption deferred** on silent
  dense-table value loss (≥47% of numeric cells at the best render; breaks
  the §9.7 fallback premise). Re-test on future builds (`TODO.md`); the
  backend work (a `deepseek-ocr-2` backend — different server template/flags,
  parser deltas, 1024–1280 render target) is scoped in the spike note.
  Research record: `dev/notes/2026-06-10-upstream-watch.md`.
- **BibTeX refinements** (§12 shipped the `auto` chain; deferred from
  `dev/plans/PLAN-bibtex-auto.md`): a `--bibtex-source` CLI axis; **Crossref** as an
  additional source; S2 **by-DOI** lookup for bioRxiv/medRxiv provenance
  (their URLs embed the `10.1101` DOI); structure-based citability heuristics
  beyond provenance; entry-type inference (`@inproceedings` etc.); `eprint`
  fields on published entries; extraction from the paper's own reference list.
- **Table reconstruction across page breaks** (§10.3) — currently a documented
  limitation.
- **Batch mode** — process a directory of PDFs reusing a single warm server.

**`MarkdownOptions` flag accounting** (all 8): `addPageNumbers`,
`addPageSeparators` (§10.1); `normalizeLineBreaks` (§10.3a); `processImages`
(→ `figure.detect = none` / `--no-figures`, with the placeholder caveat in §13.2);
`keepOriginalImages`, `replaceImagesWithPlaceholder` (→ `figure.mode`, §10.2);
`debugMode` (→ `-v`/`--keep-intermediates`). **`extractImageReferences`** only
populates a bookkeeping `imageReferences[]` list for UI use — **dropped** as
internal; inscriber tracks figures via `Region`/placeholders instead.

## 25. End-to-end worked example (one page, one figure)

A concrete trace threading §7→§12 for `paper.pdf`, page 3, which contains one
figure. (The committed M1a fixtures capture a real page of this shape —
`tests/fixtures/deepseek_paper_p1_raw.txt`.)

**1. Rasterize (§7).** Page 3 (A4, 595×842 pt) at `large` (1280px long edge):
`zoom = 1280/842 ≈ 1.52`, producing `PageImage(page_number=3, png, W=905, H=1280)`.

**2. OCR call (§8.3).** `DeepSeekOcrBackend.ocr_page` sends the page PNG (image
content-part first, §2.1) with prompt
`<|grounding|>Convert the document to markdown.`, `temperature: 0`,
`max_tokens` capped. Raw output (illustrative, in the M1a-confirmed block
format):

```
sub_title[[230, 95, 540, 120]]
## 3. Method

text[[160, 150, 840, 172]]
We train the model as shown below.

image[[300, 240, 760, 612]]
image_caption[[300, 625, 700, 645]]
<center>Figure 1: Training pipeline overview.</center>
```

**3. Parse + map coords (§8.3).** Four blocks; one figure-class block (`image`),
coords `[300, 240, 760, 612]` on the 0–999 **per-axis** grid, so
`bbox_norm = grid/999 ≈ (0.300, 0.240, 0.761, 0.613)` — no padding terms
(§2.2). The `image` block is **replaced** by
a placeholder (not deleted); the following `image_caption` block supplies
`Region.text = "<center>Figure 1: Training pipeline overview.</center>"` while
its text also stays in the markdown. Resulting `OcrPageResult.markdown`:

```
## 3. Method

We train the model as shown below.

⟦INSCRIBER_FIG:fig_p3_1⟧

<center>Figure 1: Training pipeline overview.</center>
```

**4. Crop (§8.4).** `bbox_norm` × `(905,1280)` + 2% margin → crop saved as
`figures/fig_p3_1.png`.

**5. VLM call (§9).** Context = page 3's whole text (≤2000 chars) with the
preamble `This image appears on page 3. …`; prompt assembled per §9.3; Gemma 4
returns `<img_desc>A flow diagram showing … </img_desc>`; §9.4 extracts the inner
text.

**6. Inject (§10.2), default `describe-only`.** The placeholder is replaced by:

```
> **Image description.** A flow diagram showing the three-stage training
> pipeline: data ingestion, pretraining, and fine-tuning, connected left to
> right by arrows.
```

(With `describe-and-keep`, an `![<center>Figure 1: …</center>](figures/fig_p3_1.png)`
line precedes it, alt text = `Region.text`.) §10.3 `ensureImageDescriptionSpacing`
guarantees blank lines around the block, and the `<center>…</center>` caption line
is a protected artifact line for the header/footer stripper (§10.3b).

**7. Assemble / split / write (§10–§14).** Pages concatenated → cleanup → split →
`{base}_full.md`, `{base}_main.md` / `{base}_appendix.md` /
`{base}_backmatter.md` as detected, `figures/fig_p3_1.png`, and `{base}.bib`
when BibTeX produced an entry (default `auto`, §12 — whose citation key is
then also the default `{base}`, §14).
