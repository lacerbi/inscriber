# TODO

Concrete, actionable pending items — collected here so they don't get lost
inside spec prose. Longer-horizon feature work stays in `DESIGN.md` §22; the
empirical evidence records cited below live in `dev/notes/`.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[!]` blocked.

## Pre-release review follow-ups (2026-06-11)

- [ ] **Work through the remaining pre-release review findings** — the
      2026-06-11 full-codebase review's non-blocking items, written up as a
      self-contained handoff list (each with location, rationale, suggested
      fix, and pinned-behavior/cache-key caveats):
      `dev/notes/2026-06-11-prerelease-review.md`. Highlights: Windows
      file-in-use errors in `setup` (HIGH), empty server-log tail on fast
      startup failures (HIGH), `dehyphenate` vs DESIGN §10.3b mismatch,
      figure-cache key fragile to PNG-encoder churn, arXiv XML / `http://` /
      host-matching input hardening, `tests/conftest.py` dedup. The blocking
      items (SIGTERM orphan backstop, capped streaming download,
      concurrent-port gate, README sizes) were fixed pre-release.

## Table-restructuring pass (DESIGN §9.7)

- [ ] **Guard against silent SHAPE damage** in restructured tables — the
      data-loss half of this item shipped 2026-06-10: the **digit-coverage
      guard** (`MIN_DIGIT_COVERAGE = 0.8`, DESIGN §9.7) rejects an output that
      lost a chunk of the blob's digit stream (calibrated: healthy ≥ 0.976,
      the one silent 6-row drop 0.664 —
      `dev/notes/2026-06-10-cropped-table-validation.md`). What the guard
      CANNOT see, per the validation run's residual list: blob header
      misreads faithfully propagated (`q_mild/q_strong/q_mixture` → `q&out`
      ×3 — an OCR subscript limit), sparse-row cell drift (the mostly-`—`
      SIR/RS rows misplace 1–2 cells), single-cell value slips (`±0.24` for
      `±0.19`), and digit-neutral shape damage (transposes, phantom empty
      columns). Options remain: prompt-level column-count echo (pinned
      prompt — re-validate on real hardware before touching, §9.7), a
      header-width vs image consistency probe, or flagging wide/multi-header
      tables as low-confidence in the transcription notice. Investigation
      item — no chosen design yet.
      **2026-06-11 addendum** (verification pass on a real 39-page run,
      `hassan2026efficient`): header damage is now the dominant residual
      class — 7 of 11 tables shipped with mislabeled/invented column headers
      (`TNP-A (Set 1)/(Set 2)` over four different methods), a phantom column
      shifting every label one place, an entire column silently dropped, or
      colspan group sub-headers lost — every one passing the digit guard
      (headers carry few digits; the values under the wrong labels were
      correct). Strongest candidate so far: a **header-text containment
      guard**, the label-side mirror of digit coverage — the output's
      non-numeric header tokens must (mostly) appear in the blob or the
      page-text context; invented labels fail containment while faithfully
      propagated misreads still pass (same one-sided stance as digits).
      Needs a calibrated threshold like `MIN_DIGIT_COVERAGE` — the VLM
      legitimately adds label-cell words (`Method`, `Metric`) — and the same
      keep-the-blob-on-failure handling.
- [ ] **System/user message split** of the table prompt (static instructions as
      a system message → llama-server prefix-cache reuse, possible adherence
      gain). The validated prompt is a single user message — re-validate on
      real hardware before adopting.

## Upstream llama.cpp watch (researched 2026-06-10 — `dev/notes/2026-06-10-upstream-watch.md`)

- [!] **DeepSeek-OCR 2 adoption** — the verification spike RAN 2026-06-10
      (`dev/notes/2026-06-10-dsocr2-spike-findings.md`; harness
      `dev/scripts/dsocr2_check.py`, re-runnable on any build; bf16 GGUFs
      local). All three gating questions answered: grounding format/frame
      confirmed per-axis + render-size-invariant under tiling (`grid_to_norm`
      carries over), and the v1 known-loop page (PriorGuide p. 5) completes
      cleanly with per-row equation tags. **Blocked on a new finding: dense
      tables silently lose ≥47% of numeric values at the best render**
      (PriorGuide Tables 1+2: v1 kept 216/216, v2's best was 114/216 @1024 —
      both server and mtmd-cli paths), including one blob that degenerated
      into a self-terminating spam run invisible to `finish_reason`. That
      breaks the §9.7 raw-blob fallback premise, so adoption is deferred.
      The loss is most likely a llama.cpp implementation issue (the new
      Qwen2-encoder attention mask is the prime suspect; evidence in the
      note), so the posture is wait-for-upstream: re-run the spike on future
      builds (discriminating test if needed: HF reference on the same page).
      If table retention is fixed, the backend work is scoped in the note
      (parser deltas: `figure_title` captions, caption-before-table block
      order, `table` carries its own blob, multi-`image` figures; render
      target 1024–1280 — v2's encoding saturates there, 2048 buys nothing).
- [ ] **v1 Gundam tiling** — descoped from #17400; the follow-up PR #24300 was
      closed 2026-06-09 in favor of a generic batching API (PR #24384, WIP
      draft). Watch #24384 + the DSOCR re-adaptation on top of it; stall risk
      noted in the watch doc. When it lands, revisit the gundam render-target
      item above.

## Planned features

- [ ] **Loop-breaking retry for truncated OCR pages** — detection shipped
      2026-06-10 (`finish_reason != "stop"` → page flagged `truncated`, kept
      best-effort, cached WITH the flag, re-warned on every hit; DESIGN §8.6 —
      the flag gives a repair pass its target list). Two rungs, both
      model-facing (real-hardware spike + dated note before adoption):
      (a) **per-request stronger-DRY / seed-jitter retry** — DRY params are
      per-request sampler params, so on detection re-run the page once with
      stronger DRY; risks corrupting legitimately repetitive content (table
      rows), and the same attractor may recur;
      (b) **prefix-prefill + deflection** — find the repeated suffix text-side
      (deterministic Python), prefill the assistant message up to just before
      the first repetition, and deflect the first continuation token
      (`logit_bias` ban / brief temperature burst / `n_probs`-driven
      client-side decoding at the loop point). Gated on verifying that
      llama-server supports assistant-message continuation with multimodal
      input + DeepSeek-OCR's built-in template on build 9587.
      Open: a repaired page came from different effective sampling — decide
      its cache-key material. Reminder: a loop that self-terminates under the
      cap emits `finish_reason: "stop"` and is invisible to the detector
      (DESIGN §2.2 known limitation).
- [ ] **Publish to PyPI** — the name `inscriber` was verified available
      (DESIGN §18) but nothing is published yet; README documents source
      install until then.
- [ ] **Alternate BibTeX sources** — Crossref / arXiv API as fallbacks to
      Semantic Scholar (unauthenticated 429s are common in practice; the
      degrade path is DESIGN §12), or fully-offline extraction from the paper's
      own reference list. The arXiv half shipped 2026-06-10 with BibTeX `auto`
      (S2-by-arXiv-ID + the arXiv export API fallback, DESIGN §12.1); Crossref,
      S2-by-DOI for bioRxiv/medRxiv, and reference-list extraction remain
      (DESIGN §22.2).

## Code debts (2026-06-10 implementation review)

- [ ] **`<table>` inside a fenced code block** would be mis-spliced (blob
      detection doesn't see fences). Unobserved in DeepSeek output — handle if
      another OCR backend can emit fenced HTML. (The companion edge case, a
      nested `<table>`, is now guarded in `blob_is_refinable`; the VLM-pass
      scaffolding consolidation from this review also landed — one backend
      instance + prompt-assembled-once, DESIGN §9.2.)
